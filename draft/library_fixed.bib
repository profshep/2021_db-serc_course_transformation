abstract = {An emphasis on higher-order thinking within the curriculum has been a subject of interest in the chemical and STEM literature due to its ability to promote meaningful, transferable learning in students. The systematic use of learning taxonomies could be a practical way to scaffold student learning in order to achieve this goal. This work proposes the use of Marzano's Taxonomy of Learning. Because it offers a functional way to distinguish lower from higher-order thinking, the taxonomy is particularly useful to instructors interested in helping students develop these skills. We outline and provide examples of how it was used in constructing Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs), class activities, and assessments for a first semester general chemistry course. Preliminary observations of the impact of this methodology on student learning are presented.},

abstract = {Proteins exhibit structural fluctuations over decades of time scales. From the picosecond side chain motions to aggregates that form over the course of minutes, characterizing protein structure over these vast lengths of time is important to understanding their function. In the past 15 years, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) has been established as a versatile tool that can uniquely probe proteins structures on many time scales. In this review, we present some of the basic principles behind 2D IR and show how they have, and can, impact the field of protein biophysics. We highlight experiments in which 2D IR spectroscopy has provided structural and dynamical data that would be difficult to obtain with more standard structural biology techniques. We also highlight technological developments in 2D IR that continue to expand the scope of scientific problems that can be accessed in the biomedical sciences.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (2D HD-VSFG) spectroscopy is performed for an aqueous interface for the first time. The 2D HD-VSFG spectra in the OH stretch region are obtained from a positively charged surfactant/water interface with isotopically diluted water (HOD/D(2)O) to reveal the femtosecond vibrational dynamics of water at the charged interface. The 2D HD-VSFG spectrum is diagonally elongated immediately after photoexcitation, clearly demonstrating inhomogeneity in the interfacial water. This elongation almost disappears at 300 fs owing to the spectral diffusion. Interestingly, the 2D HD-VSFG spectrum at the 0 fs shows an oppositely asymmetric shape to the corresponding 2D IR spectrum in bulk water: The bandwidth of the bleach signal gets narrower when the pump wavenumber becomes higher. This suggests that the dynamics and mechanism of the hydrogen bond rearrangement at the charged interface are significantly different from those in bulk water.},

Usually, the stabilities of ionic liquids are highlighted as one of their outstanding advantages. However, are ionic liquids really stable in all cases? This review covers the chemical stabilities of ionic liquids. It focuses on the reactivity of the most popular imidazolium ionic liquids at structural positions, including C2 position, N1 and N3 positions, and C4 and C5 positions, and decomposition on the imidazolium ring. Additionally, we discuss decomposition of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium ionic liquids and hydrolysis and nucleophilic reactions of anions of ionic liquids. The review aims to arouse caution on potential decomposition of ionic liquids and provides a guide for better utilization of ionic liquids.},

abstract = {One-dimensional and frequency-selected ultrafast infrared vibrational echo experiments on the CO stretching mode of a metalloporphyrin carbonyl compound in poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) and in 2-methylteterahydrofuran (2-MTHF) were compared. By selecting the proper detection wavelengths, the frequency-selected vibrational echo permits the independent detection of the dephasing dynamics associated with 0–1 and 1–2 vibrational transitions, eliminating cross terms and anharmonic beats that occur in the 1D echo signals. In PMMA, the dephasing dynamics associated with the 0–1 transition are single exponential at low and high temperatures, suggesting motional narrowed homogeneous dephasing imbedded in a massively inhomogeneously broadened line. In 2-MTHF liquid, 0–1 transition dephasing dynamics are exponential at low temperature, but, the are non-exponential at high temperatures, demonstrating that a variety of time scales of solvent fluctuations contribute to the dephasing dynamics. In the high temperature 2-MTHF liquid, 0–1 and 1−2 dephasing dynamics are essentially identical. Aspects of the negative delay time signals are also discussed.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics for CO2 absorption in ionic liquid reverse micelle (ILRM) were studied using molecular simulations. The ILRM consisted of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF4]) ionic liquid (IL) as the micelle core, the benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium ([BHD]+) chloride ([Cl]−) was the cationic surfactant, and benzene was used as the continuous solvent phase in this study. The diffusivity values of this ILRM system were also experimentally determined. Simulations indicate that there is ion exchange between the IL anion ([BF4]−) and the surfactant anion ([Cl]−). It was also found that the [bmim][BF4] IL exhibits small local density at the interface region between the IL core and the [BHD]+ surfactant cation layer, which leads to a smaller density for the [bmim][BF4] IL inside the reverse micelle (RM) compared with the neat IL. These simulation findings are consistent with experimental results. Both our simulations and experimental results show that [bmim][BF4] inside the RM diffuses 5–26 times faster than the neat IL, which is partly due to the fast particle diffusion for the ILRM nanodroplet (IL and surfactant) as a whole in benzene solvent compared with neat [bmim][BF4] diffusion. Additionally, it was found that [bmim][BF4] IL solved in benzene diffuses 2 orders of magnitude faster than the neat IL. Lastly, simulations show that CO2 molecules are absorbed in four different regions of the ILRM system, that is, (I) in the IL inner core, (II) in the [BHD]+ surfactant cation layer, (III) at the interface between the [BHD]+ surfactant cation layer and benzene solvent, and (IV) in the benzene solvent. The CO2 solubility was found to decrease in the order II > III ∼ IV > I, while the CO2 diffusivity and permeability decrease in the following order: IV > III > II > I.},

Using 1–13C=18O1–13C=18Oisotope labeling, the amide I mode of the 49-Leucine residue was spectroscopically isolated and the homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths of this mode were measured by fitting the 2D IR spectrum collected with a photon echo pulse sequence. The pure dephasing and inhomogeneous linewidths are 2 and 32 cm−1, respectively. The population relaxation time of the amide I band was measured with a transient grating, and it contributes 9 cm−1 to the linewidth. Comparison of the 49-Leucine amide I mode and the amide I band of the entire CD3$\zeta$ peptide reveals that the vibrational dynamics are not uniform along the length of the peptide. Possible origins for the large amount of inhomogeneity present at the 49-Leucine site are discussed.},

Substantial rotational excitation is found under conditions typically used in time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. The broad rotational wave packet excited by the laser pulse is well defined in the conjugate angle space, peaking along the field polarization direction. Both the rotational excitation and the consequent spatial alignment can be controlled by the choice of field parameters. Fragment angular distributions following weak field photodissociation of the rotational wave packet are computed as a probe of the degree of alignment. In the limit of rapid photodissociation the angular distribution is peaked in the forward direction, reflecting the anisotropy of the aligned state. Potential applications of the effect demonstrated range from reaction dynamics of aligned molecules and laser-control to material deposition and laser-assisted isotope separation.},

The new method was applied to study vibrational relaxation pathways in the liquid HDO/D2O system. We determined the lifetimes of OH stretching vibrations to be in the range 310-500 fs depending on the isotopic dilution, which is in good agreement with the results from pump-probe femtosecond infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, we observed a strong coupling of OH stretch to OD stretch vibrations and possibly also to the librational modes of water.},

The self-diffusion coefficients of the individual components, emim, BF4, and Li, were measured by using H-1, F-19, and Li-7 pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR, respectively. Since the Walden product holds similar to typical solution electrolytes, the ion conduction mechanism is interpreted using a flux basis electrolyte theory. The ions form associated structures and diffuse under the influence of the counterions in the binary IL systems. An attempt to correlate the ion diffusion with the ionic conduction was made in the framework of the Nernst-Einstein relationship. The Li net transference number and the apparent ion activity are also discussed.},

abstract = {In this report, spectral simulations and isotope labeling are used to describe the two-dimensional IR spectroscopy of $\beta$$\beta$-hairpin peptides in the amide I spectral region. 2D IR spectra of Gramicidin S, PG12, Trpzip2 (TZ2), and TZ2-T3∗T10∗TZ2-T3*T10*, a dual C′13C′13isotope label, are qualitatively described by a model based on the widely used local mode amide I Hamiltonian. The authors' model includes methods for calculating site energies for individual amide oscillators on the basis of hydrogen bonding, nearest neighbor and long-range coupling between sites, and disorder in the site energy. The dependence of the spectral features on the peptide backbone structure is described using disorder-averaged eigenstates, which are visualized by mapping back onto the local amide I sites. $\beta$$\beta$-hairpin IR spectra are dominated by delocalized vibrations that vary by the phase of adjacent oscillators parallel and perpendicular to the strands. The dominant $\nu$⊥$\nu$⊥ band is sensitive to the length of the hairpin and the amount of twisting in the backbone structure, while the $\nu$‖$\nu$‖ band is composed of several low symmetry modes that delocalize along the strands. The spectra of TZ2-T3∗T10∗TZ2-T3*T10* are used to compare coupling models, from which we conclude that transition charge coupling is superior to transition dipole coupling for amide groups directly hydrogen bound across the $\beta$$\beta$ strands. The 2D IR spectra of TZ2-T3∗T10∗TZ2-T3*T10* are used to resolve the redshifted amide I band and extract the site energy of the labeled groups. This allows the authors to compare several methods for calculating the site energies used in excitonic treatments of the amide I band. Gramicidin S is studied in dimethyl sulfoxide to test the role of solvent on the spectral simulations.},

abstract = {Using a derivative of the vitamin biotin labeled with a transition-metal carbonyl vibrational probe in a series of aqueous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solutions, we observe a striking slowdown in spectral diffusion dynamics with decreased DMF concentration. Equilibrium solvation dynamics, measured with the rapidly acquired spectral diffusion (RASD) technique, a variant of heterodyne-detected photon–echo peak shift experiments, range from 1 ps in neat DMF to ∼3 ps in 0.07 mole fraction DMF/water solution. Molecular dynamics simulations of the biotin–metal carbonyl solute in explicit aqueous DMF solutions show marked preferential solvation by DMF, which becomes more pronounced at lower DMF concentrations. The simulations and the experimental data are consistent with an interpretation where the slowdown in spectral diffusion is due to solvent exchange involving distinct cosolvent species. A simple two-component model reproduces the observed spectral dynamics as well as the DMF concentration dependence, enabling the extraction of the solvent exchange time scale of 8 ps. This time scale corresponds to the diffusive motion of a few {\AA}, consistent with a solvent-exchange mechanism. Unlike most previous studies of solvation dynamics in binary mixtures of polar solvents, our work highlights the ability of vibrational probes to sense solvent exchange as a new, slow component in the spectral diffusion dynamics.},

abstract = {The viscosities of 23 ionic liquid (IL)−IL mixtures were measured at multiple temperatures and mole fractions. Many of the mixtures involved a dialkylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Tf 2 N]) IL paired with a tetra-alkylphosphonium IL containing an aprotic heterocyclic anion (AHA). As a result, most of the mixtures contained both unlike anions and cations. The mixtures ranged from strongly positive deviations from the Arrhenius model (the mole fraction weighted logarithm of the viscosity), even having mixture viscosities greater than the viscosity of either pure IL, to negative deviations. Studies of complementary pairs ([C 1 ][A 1 ] + [C 2 ][A 2 ] and [C 2 ][A 1 ] + [C 1 ][A 2 ] mixtures) have identical viscosities at overall mole fractions of 0.50, clearly indicating that the anions and cations of the mixtures exchange freely. These mixtures cannot be well-represented by the Arrhenius model assuming a random distribution of the four possible cation/anion combinations (e.g., 0.25 mole fraction of each possibility at an overall IL mole fraction of 0.50). Rather, if one assumes preferential formation of some cation/anion pairs to match the experimental viscosity data at a 0.50 IL mole fraction, a much better representation of the data can be obtained. However, additional IL−IL interactions are needed to explain maxima in the experimental viscosity data. Excess molar volumes are very small for all of the systems measured. ■ INTRODUCTION There are many reasons why one might be interested in mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs). The most obvious is to combine the desirable properties of two different ILs, if one cannot identify a single IL that satisfies all requirements. Another is the possibility of forming eutectic mixtures, where the melting point of the mixture can be lower than the melting point of either pure IL. Uses for IL−IL mixtures previously investigated include as electrolytes in dye-sensitized solar cells 1 and in liquid−liquid extraction, which take advantage of the properties of both of the pure ILs to enhance their properties. 2,3 Key properties that have been measured for IL mixtures are conductivity and viscosity, and these are discussed below. In addition, a few groups have measured other properties of IL−IL mixtures, including the distribution ratio of Pd(III), 4 liquid−liquid equilibrium, 5,6 gas chromatographic stationary phase separation ability, 7 density and excess molar volume, 8,9 surface tension, 10−12 CO 2 solubility and Henry's law constants, 13−17 optical Kerr effect, 18 and T onset . 12},

abstract = {In this paper, we report on our investigation into the vibrational dynamics of the antisymmetric stretching modes of SCN(-) and N(3)(-) in several polar solvents. We used an infrared (IR) pump-probe method to study orientational relaxation processes. In two aprotic solvents (N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), the anisotropy decay shows a bimodal feature, whereas in other solvents the anisotropy decay can be fitted well by a single exponential function. We consider that the relative contribution of fast-decaying components is smaller in the other solvents than in DMF and DMSO. We discuss the possible origins of the different anisotropy decay behavior in different solvents. From the three-pulse IR photon echo measurements for SCN(-) and N(3)(-), we found that the time-correlation functions (TCFs) of vibrational frequency fluctuations decay on two different time scales, one of which is less than 100 fs and the other is approximately 3-6 ps. In aprotic solvents, the fast-decaying components of the TCFs on a <100 fs time scale play an important role in the vibrational frequency fluctuation, although the contribution of collective solvent reorganization in aprotic solvents was clearly observed to have small amplitudes. On the other hand, we found that the amplitude of components that decay in a few picoseconds and/or the constant offset of the TCF in protic solvents is relatively large compared with that in aprotic solvents. With the formation and dissociation of hydrogen bonds between ion solute and solvent molecules, the spectra of different solvated species are exchanged with each other and merged into one band. We considered that this exchange may be an origin of slow-decaying components of the TCFs and that the decay of the TCFs corresponds to the time scales of the exchange for protic solvents such as formamide. The mechanism of vibrational frequency fluctuations for the antisymmetric stretching modes of SCN(-) and N(3)(-) is discussed in terms of the difference between protic and aprotic solvents.},

Energetic and structural analyses determined that the improved SNAr reactivity in [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6] can be attributed to (1) an enhanced nucleophilicity of the cyclic amines in the ionic liquids with an order of Pyr ≥ Pip > Mor, (2) beneficial $\pi$(+)-$\pi$ interactions between the BMIM cations and the aromatic rings present on the substrate that enhanced coplanarity between the thiophene ring and the aromatic substituents, resulting in a larger positive charge on the reacting ipso carbon, and (3) a highly ordered ionic liquid clathrate formation that, despite an entropy penalty, provided reduced activation free-energy barriers derived from an increasing number of solvent ions favorably interacting with the emerging charge separation at the rate-limiting addition step.},

abstract = {Cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures are common motifs in biological systems, providing structural stability and mediating proton transfer for redox reactions. The mechanism of proton transfer across hydrogen-bonded interfaces depends on the strength of the intermolecular coupling between bridging OH/NH vibrational modes. Here we present a novel ultrafast continuum mid-IR spectroscopy experiment to study the vibrational dynamics of the 7-azaindole-acetic acid (7AI-Ac) heterodimer as a model system for asymmetric cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. In addition to spreading of the excitation across the whole OH band within the time resolution of the experiment, excitation of a 300 cm(-1) region of the ∼1000 cm(-1) broad OH stretching mode of the acetic acid monomer leads to a frequency shift in the NH stretching mode of the 7AI monomer. This indicates that the NH and OH stretching modes located on the two monomers are strongly coupled despite being separated by 750 cm(-1). The strong coupling further causes the OH and NH bands to decay with a common decay time of ∼2.5 ps. This intermolecular coupling is mediated through the hydrogen-bonded structure of the 7AI-Ac heterodimer and is likely a general property of cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. Characterizing the vibrational dynamics of and the coupling between the high-frequency OH/NH modes will be important for understanding proton transfer across such molecular interfaces.},

Because the OH absorption frequency is sensitive to the details of the atomic forces experienced in the liquid, our results provide important quantitative comparisons for several popular empirical water potentials. When compared with their fixed-charge counterparts, the polarizable models give similar slower long time constants for the decay of vibrational correlations and reorientational motion that is in better agreement with experiments. Polarizable potentials yield qualitatively dissimilar predictions for frequency fluctuations and transition dipole moment fluctuations at equilibrium. Models that confine the polarizability to the plane of the molecule (i.e., TIP4P–FQ) overestimate the width of the distribution describing frequency fluctuations by more than a factor of two. These models also underestimate the amplitude of the hydrogen-bond stretch at 170 cm–1. A potential that has both an out-of-plane polarization and fluctuating charges, POL5–TZ, compares best with experiments. We interpret our findings in terms of microscopic dynamics and make suggestions that may improve the quality of emerging polarizable force fields for water.},

The observed time dependences of HPTS are compared with those of the methoxy derivative, MPTS. A global fitting procedure is employed to model both the spectral shift (Stokes shift) caused by solvent reorganization and deprotonation of pyranine in water. Three distinct time-dependent features can be clearly identified. They are the Stokes shift (1 ps in H2O and 1.5 ps in D2O), followed by the deprotonation processes, which gives rise to a biexponential decay of the protonated species with time constants (in H2O) of 3 and 88 ps. By the use of a model previously discussed in the literature, the biexponential process can be interpreted as an initial deprotonation step followed by the longer time scale process which separates the resulting ion pair. The results presented here are consistent with some of the previous reports but unambiguously identify and quantitatively measure the Stokes shift as a separate and distinct phenomenon from the deprotonation process, in contrast to other reports that have suggested that all short time (a few picoseconds) dynamics are merely a Stokes shift.

abstract = {We study the structure and reorientation dynamics of nanometer-sized water droplets inside nonionic reverse micelles (water/Igepal-CO-520/cyclohexane) with time-resolved mid-infrared pump-probe spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering. In the time-resolved experiments, we probe the vibrational and orientational dynamics of the O-D bonds of dilute HDO:H(2)O mixtures in Igepal reverse micelles as a function of temperature and micelle size. We find that even small micelles contain a large fraction of water that reorients at the same rate as water in the bulk, which indicates that the polyethylene oxide chains of the surfactant do not penetrate into the water volume. We also observe that the confinement affects the reorientation dynamics of only the first hydration layer. From the temperature dependent surface-water dynamics, we estimate an activation enthalpy for reorientation of 45 ± 9 kJ mol(-1) (11 ± 2 kcal mol(-1)), which is close to the activation energy of the reorientation of water molecules in ice.},

abstract = {The Ca 2+ -sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) is a popular model of biological ion binding since it is both experimentally tractable and essential to survival in all eukaryotic cells. CaM modulates hundreds of target proteins and is sensitive to complex patterns of Ca 2+ exposure, indicating that it functions as a sophisticated dynamic transducer rather than a simple on/off switch. Many details of this transduction function are not well understood. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultrafast 2D infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, and electronic structure calculations were used to probe interactions between bound metal ions (Ca 2+ and several trivalent lanthanide ions) and the carboxylate groups in CaM's EF-hand ion-coordinating sites. Since Tb 3+ is commonly used as a luminescent Ca 2+ analog in studies of protein−ion binding, it is important to characterize distinctions between the coordination of Ca 2+ and the lanthanides in CaM. Although functional assays indicate that Tb 3+ fully activates many Ca 2+ -dependent proteins, our FTIR spectra indicate that Tb 3+ , La 3+ , and Lu 3+ disrupt the bidentate coordination geometry characteristic of the CaM binding sites' strongly conserved position 12 glutamate residue. The 2D IR spectra indicate that, relative to the Ca 2+ -bound form, lanthanide-bound CaM exhibits greater conformational flexibility and larger structural fluctuations within its binding sites. Time-dependent 2D IR lineshapes indicate that binding sites in Ca 2+ −CaM occupy well-defined configurations, whereas binding sites in lanthanide-bound-CaM are more disordered. Overall, the results show that binding to lanthanide ions significantly alters the conformation and dynamics of CaM's binding sites.},

abstract = {For both two- and three-level systems, theoretical descriptions of two-color transient grating, transient dichroism, and transient birefringence spectroscopies were presented. The two-dimensional line shapes of these pump-probe spectra were found to be strongly dependent on the solvation dynamics. The two-dimensional contours of the transient birefringence signal of a two-level system are not vertically directed in the short time region. The inverse slope of the tangential line of the two-dimensional contours was found to be linearly proportional to the solvation correlation function. The two-dimensional transient grating and dichroism spectra are shown to directly provide quantitative information on the reorganization energy and spectral diffusion dynamics. For a three-level system that is a model for an anharmonic oscillator, the peak separation observed in a two-dimensional transient dichroism spectrum was found to be determined by both fluctuation amplitude of the transition frequency and spectral bandwidth of the probe pulse. The transient dichroism and birefringence contours of a three-level system were also found to be tilted in the short time region. We, in the present paper, established a variety of relationships between two-dimensional pump-probe line shapes and solvation correlation function.},

This is a typical RTIL, which form micellar structure above certain concentration of the RTIL (0.031 M). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements show that the average hydrodynamic diameter ( Dh) of a [C4mim][C8SO4]-water micelle is 2.8 (+/-0.2) nm. Both the solvent and rotational relaxation of C-153 are retarded in this micelle compared to the solvation time of a similar type of dye in neat water. However, the solvent relaxation in this ionic liquid surfactant is different from that of a conventional ionic surfactant. The slow component of the solvation dynamics in C8H17SO4Na or TX-100 micelle is on the nanoseconds time scale, whereas in [C4mim][C8SO4] micelle the same component is on the subnanoseconds time scale. The different molecular motions with different time scale is the main reason behind this difference in the solvation time in micelles composed of RTIL with other conventional micelles.},

The different variants of 2D vibrational spectroscopy are based on either the even-order or the odd-order nonlinear susceptibility, and all allow resolving similar molecular temporal and spectral information.

abstract = {Time-resolved sum frequency generation (tr-SFG) reveals that the vibrational energy relaxation rate of O-H stretching of dilute HDO in D(2)O at the silica interface is markedly different from that of bulk water. As compared to the bulk liquid, the vibrational lifetime (T(1)) of HDO is shorter at the charged surface than in the bulk, but longer at the neutral surface. The vibrational decoupling of the O-H of the HDO species leads to the observation of a frequency-dependent T(1) of the O-H stretch, which is shorter at the red than the blue side of the hydrogen-bonded OH spectral region. This correlates with the red-shift of the SFG spectra with increasing surface charge and is consistent with a theoretical model that relates the vibrational lifetime to the strength of the hydrogen-bond network.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of large membrane-associated proteins are limited by the difficulties in preparation of stable protein-detergent mixed micelles and by line broadening, which is typical of these macroassemblies. We have used the 68-kDa homotetrameric KcsA, a thermostable N-terminal deletion mutant of a bacterial potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans, as a model system for applying NMR methods to membrane proteins. Optimization of measurement conditions enabled us to perform the backbone assignment of KcsA in SDS micelles and establish its secondary structure, which was found to closely agree with the KcsA crystal structure. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, absent in the original structure, contains a 14-residue helix that could participate in tetramerization by forming an intersubunit four-helix bundle. A quantitative estimate of cross-relaxation between detergent and KcsA backbone amide protons, together with relaxation and light scattering data, suggests SDS-KcsA mixed micelles form an oblate spheroid with similar to 180 SDS molecules per channel. K+ ions bind to the micelle-solubilized channel with a K-D of 3 +/- 0.5 mM, resulting in chemical shift changes in the selectivity filter. Related pH-induced changes in chemical shift along the "outer" transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic membrane interface hint at a possible structural explanation for the observed pH-gating of the potassium channel.},

abstract = {Ultrafast dynamics of protein side chains are involved in important biological processes such as ligand binding, protein folding, and hydration. In addition, the dynamics of a side chain can report on local environments within proteins. While protein side chain dynamics have been probed for proteins in solution with nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared methods for decades, information about side chain dynamics at interfaces is lacking. At the same time, the dynamics and motions of side chains can be particularly important for interfacial binding and protein-driven surface manipulation. We here demonstrate that ultrafast reorientation dynamics of leucine amino acids at interfaces can be recorded in situ and in real time using polarization- and time-resolved pump-probe sum frequency generation (SFG). Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, time-resolved SFG was used to probe the reorientation of the isopropyl methyl groups of l-leucine at the air-water interface. The data show that the methyl units reorient diffusively at an in plane rate of D$\phi$ = 0.07 rad(2)/ps and an out of plane rate of D$\theta$ = 0.05 rad(2)/ps.},

QM/MM Monte Carlo simulations utilizing free-energy perturbation theory were used to characterize the solute-solvent interactions over the addition-elimination reaction pathway. Energetic and structural analyses determined that the improved SNAr reactivity in [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6] can be attributed to (1) an enhanced nucleophilicity of the cyclic amines in the ionic liquids with an order of Pyr ≥ Pip > Mor, (2) beneficial $\pi$(+)-$\pi$ interactions between the BMIM cations and the aromatic rings present on the substrate that enhanced coplanarity between the thiophene ring and the aromatic substituents, resulting in a larger positive charge on the reacting ipso carbon, and (3) a highly ordered ionic liquid clathrate formation that, despite an entropy penalty, provided reduced activation free-energy barriers derived from an increasing number of solvent ions favorably interacting with the emerging charge separation at the rate-limiting addition step.},

abstract = {The ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (bmimBF4) can form nonaqueous microemulsions with benzene by the aid of nonionic surfactant TX-100. The effect of water on ionic liquid-in-oil (IL/O) microemulsions was studied, and it was shown that the addition of small amount of water to the IL microemulsion contributed to the stability of microemulsion and thus increased the amount of solubilized bmimBF4 in the microemulsion. The conductivity measurements also showed that the attractive interactions between IL microdroplets were weakened, that is, the IL/O microemulsion becomes more stable in the present of some water. Fourier transform IR was carried out to analyze the states of the added water, and the result showed that these water molecules mainly behaved as bound water and trapped water, indicating that the water molecules are located in the palisade layers of the IL/O microemulsion. Furthermore, 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectra suggested that the added water molecules built the hydrogen binding network of imidazolium cations and H2O, BF4- anion and H2O, and at the same time the electronegative oxygen atoms of the oxyethylene units of TX-100 and water in the palisade layers, which made the palisade layers more firm and thus increased the stability of the microemulsion. The study can help in further understanding the formation mechanism of microemulsions. In addition, the characteristic solubilization behavior of the added water can provide an aqueous interface film for hydrolysis reactions and therefore may be used as an ideal medium to prepare porous or hollow nanomaterials.},

abstract = {Current efforts in structural biology aim to integrate structural information within the context of cellular organization and function. X-rays and infrared radiation stand at opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum and act as complementary probes for achieving this goal. Intense and bright beams are produced by synchrotron radiation, and are efficiently used in the wavelength domain extending from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (or THz) regime. While X-ray crystallography provides exquisite details on atomic structure, Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIRM) is emerging as a spectroscopic probe and imaging tool for correlating molecular structure to biochemical dynamics and function. In this manuscript, the role of synchrotron FTIRM in bridging the gap towards 'functional biology' is discussed based upon recent achievements, with a critical assessment of the contributions to biological and biomedical research. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs), vary strongly in their interaction with CO2. We suggest simple theoretical approach to predict the CO2 absorption behavior of ILs. Strong interaction of the CO2 with the IL anions corresponds to chemical absorption whereas weak interaction indicates physical absorption. A predictive estimate with a clear distinction between physical and chemical absorption can be simply obtained according to geometries optimized in the presence of a solvation model instead of optimizing it only in gas phase as has been done to date. The resulting Gibbs free energies compare very well with experimental values and the energies were correlated with experimental capacities. Promising anions, for ionic liquids with reversible CO2 absorption properties can be defined by a reaction Gibbs free energy of absorption in the range of −30 to 16 kJ mol−1.},

abstract = {The structures and vibrational frequencies of the acetate ion interacting with a metal ion (Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in the unidentate, bidentate, bridging, and pseudobridging forms are studied by nb initio molecular orbital calculations. Effects of a water molecule coordinating to either the acetate ion or the metal ion are also examined. The calculations are carried out by using the self-consistent reaction field method at the Hartree-Fock level with the 6-31+G** basis set. For the species interacting with a divalent metal cation, the lengths of the two CO bonds of the acetate ion are nearly equal in the bidentate form but are significantly different in the unidentate form. The frequency of the COO- antisymmetric stretch of the unidentate species is higher than that of the ionic species, which is in turn higher than that of the bidentate species. The reverse is the case for the COO- symmetric stretch. As a result, the frequency separations (Delta nu(a-s)) between the COO- antisymmetric and symmetric stretches for the unidentate, bidentate, and ionic species are in the following order: Delta nu(a-s), (unidentate) > Delta nu(a-s) (ionic) > Delta nu(a-s) (bidentate). It is demonstrated that such a correlation between the vibrational frequencies of the COO- group and the types of its coordination to a divalent metal cation is related to changes in the CO bond lengths and the OCO angle. The results of the present study clarify the physical basis of the empirical structure-frequency correlation, which has been used in the analysis of the infrared spectra of Ca2+-binding proteins.},

The structure suggests a molecular mechanism that underlies MscS gating and its decay of conductivity during prolonged activation.

abstract = {The properties of water molecules located close to an interface deviate significantly from those observed in the homogeneous bulk liquid. The length scale over which this structural perturbation persists (the so-called interfacial depth) is the object of extensive investigations. The situation is particularly complicated in the presence of surface charges that can induce long-range orientational ordering of water molecules, which in turn dictate diverse processes, such as mineral dissolution, heterogeneous catalysis, and membrane chemistry. To characterize the fundamental properties of interfacial water, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on alkali chloride solutions in the presence of two types of idealized charged surfaces: one with the charge density localized at discrete sites and the other with a homogeneously distributed charge density. We find that, in addition to a diffuse region where water orientation shows no layering, the interface region consists of a "compact layer" of solvent next to the surface that is not described in classical electric double layer theories. The depth of the diffuse solvent layer is sensitive to the type of charge distributions on the surface and the ionic strength. Simulations of the aqueous interface of a realistic model of negatively charged amorphous silica show that the water orientation and the distribution of ions strongly depend on the identity of the cations (Na(+) vs Cs(+)) and are not well represented by a simplistic homogeneous charge distribution model. While the compact layer shows different solvent net orientation and depth for Na(+) vs Cs(+), the depth (∼1 nm) of the diffuse layer of oriented waters is independent of the identity of the cation screening the charge. The details of interfacial water orientation revealed here go beyond the traditionally used double and triple layer models and provide a microscopic picture of the aqueous/mineral interface that complements recent surface specific experimental studies.},

abstract = {We present a mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics study of the nonequilibrium hydrogen-bond dynamics following vibrational energy relaxation of the hydroxyl stretch in a 10 mol % methanol/carbon tetrachloride mixture and pure methanol. The ground and first-excited energy levels and wave functions are identified with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hydroxyl's adiabatic Hamiltonian and as such depend parametrically on the configuration of the remaining, classically treated, degrees of freedom. The dynamics of the classical degrees of freedom are in turn governed by forces obtained by taking the expectation value of the force with respect to the ground or excited vibrational wave functions. Polarizable force fields and nonlinear mapping relations between the hydroxyl transition frequencies and dipole moments and the electric field along the hydroxyl bond are used, which were previously shown to quantitatively reproduce the experimental infrared steady-state absorption spectra and excited state lifetime [Kwac, K.; Geva, E. J. Phys. Chem. B 2011, 115, 9184; 2012, 116, 2856]. The relaxation from the first-excited state to the ground state is treated as a nonadiabatic transition. Within the mixed quantum-classical treatment, relaxation from the excited state to the ground state is accompanied by a momentum-jump in the classical degrees of freedom, which is in turn dictated by the nonadiabatic coupling vector. We find that the momentum jump leads to breaking of hydrogen bonds involving the relaxing hydroxyl, thereby blue-shifting the transition frequency by more than the Stokes shift between the steady-state emission and absorption spectra. The subsequent nonequilibrium relaxation toward equilibrium on the ground state potential energy surface is thereby accompanied by red shifting of the transition frequency. The signature of this nonequilibrium relaxation process on the pump-probe spectrum is analyzed in detail. The calculated pump-probe spectrum is found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment, thereby providing further credibility to the underlying force fields and mixed quantum-classical methodology.},

Its precursor in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, lanosterol, has been argued by Konrad Bloch (Bloch, K. 1965. Science. 150:19-28; 1983. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 14:47-92; 1994.

We present a comparative study of the effects of cholesterol and lanosterol on molecular conformational order and phase equilibria of lipid-bilayer membranes. By using deuterium NMR spectroscopy on multilamellar lipid-sterol systems in combination with Monte Carlo simulations of microscopic models of lipid-sterol interactions, we demonstrate that the evolution in the molecular chemistry from lanosterol to cholesterol is manifested in the model lipid-sterol membranes by an increase in the ability of the sterols to promote and stabilize a particular membrane phase, the liquid-ordered phase, and to induce collective order in the acyl-chain conformations of lipid molecules. We also discuss the biological relevance of our results, in particular in the context of membrane domains and rafts.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bonding increases the magnitude of the OH stretching transition dipole moment. We investigate the significance of this non-Condon effect on the linear and nonlinear infrared spectroscopy of the OH stretching vibration of HOD in D2O. The frequency dependence of the transition dipole across the line shape is tested by comparing temperature-dependent amplitudes of IR and Raman spectra and IR photon echoes. Since the Raman polarizability is largely independent of hydrogen bonding, differences between IR and Raman spectra reflect the changes in the IR transition dipole moment induced by hydrogen bonding. Increasing temperature shifts the OH density of states to higher frequencies consistent with a weakening of hydrogen bond strength and therefore a decrease in the transition dipole. Photon echo intensity is found to decrease significantly with temperature. Using an empirical transition dipole variation determined from the square root of the ratio of the IR and Raman intensity, we are able to model the IR spectra and the IR photon echo across a broad temperature range. The variation with frequency of this empirical transition dipole is nonlinear, changes by a factor of 1.7 across the OH line shape, and on resonance has a slope similar to recent theoretical predictions. The role of water dynamics and motional narrowing on the non-Condon effect is evaluated with the help of molecular dynamics simulations of the fluctuating OH frequency and transition dipole moment. Simulated linear and two-dimensional infrared line shapes that use the empirical model are red shifted compared to line shapes calculated within the Condon approximation, and give slightly better agreement with measured data.},

The experiments measure the time evolution of the 2D spectra of the hydroxyl (OD) stretching mode of the phenol. The time-dependent 2D spectra are analyzed using time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation theory with a model that includes the chemical exchange (formation and dissociation of the complexes), spectral diffusion of both the complex and the free phenol, orientational relaxation of the complexes and free phenol, and the vibrational lifetimes. The detailed calculations are able to reproduce the experimental results and demonstrate that a method employed previously that used a kinetic model for the volumes of the peaks is adequate to extract the exchange kinetics. The current analysis also yields the spectral diffusion (time evolution of the dynamic line widths) and shows that the spectral diffusion is significantly different for phenol complexes and free phenol.},

abstract = {The processes by which solvated electrons are generated and\nundergo recombination are of great interest in condensed phase\nphysical chemistry because of their relevance to both electron\ntransfer reactions and radiation chemistry. Although most of the\nwork in this area has focused on aqueous systems, many outstanding\nquestions remain, especially concerning the nature of these\nprocesses in low polarity solvents where the solvated electron has\na fundamentally different structure. In this paper, we use\nfemtosecond spectroscopic techniques to explore the dynamics of\nsolvated electrons in tetrahydrofuran (THF) that are produced in\ntwo different ways: ejection by multiphoton ionization of the neat\nsolvent, and detachment via the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS)\ntransition of sodide (Na-). Following multiphoton ionization of\nthe solvent, the recombination of solvated electrons can be well\ndescribed by a simple model that assumes electrons are first\nejected to a given thermalization distance and then move\ndiffusively in the presence of the Coulombic attraction with their\ngeminate cation. The short-time transient absorption dynamics of\nthe THF radical cation in the visible region of the spectrum do\nnot match the kinetics of the solvated electron probed at similar\nto2 mum, indicating that caution is warranted when drawing\nconclusions about recombination based only on the dynamics of the\nsolvent cation absorption. With similar to4 eV of excess energy,\ngeminate recombination takes place on the hundreds of picoseconds\ntime scale, corresponding to thermalization distances greater than\nor equal to 40 Angstrom. The recombination of solvated electrons\nejected via CTTS detachment of Na-, on the other hand, takes place\non two distinct time scales of less than or equal to2 and similar\nto 200 ps with kinetics that cannot be adequately fit by simple\ndiffusive models. The fraction of electrons that undergo the fast\nrecombination process decreases with increasing excitation energy\nor intensity. These facts lead us to conclude that electrons\nlocalize in the vicinity of their geminate Na atom partners,\nproducing either directly overlapping or solvent-separated contact\npairs. The distinct recombination kinetics for the two separate\nelectron generation processes serve to emphasize the differences\nbetween them: multiphoton ionization produces a delocalized\nelectron whose wave function samples the structure of the\nequilibrium fluid before undergoing localization, while CTTS is an\nelectron transfer reaction with dynamics controlled by the motions\nof solvent molecules adjacent to the parent ion. All the results\nare compared to recent experiments on the photodetachment of\nelectrons in aqueous systems where contact pairs are also thought\nto be important, allowing us to develop a qualitative picture for\nthe mechanisms of electron generation and recombination in\ndifferent solvent environments.

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital technology for the cost-effective mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, a key obstacle to its deployment on a large scale remains its cost – both capital and operating costs. In this context, the development of improved sorbents is a key research priority. Consequently, there is a vast global effort to develop new materials for this purpose, with literally thousands of new materials having been proposed since the beginning of the millennium. One common element of these contributions is that they focus on the equilibrium capacity of the material to absorb CO2 and rarely, if ever, other key factors such as transport properties. To date, the majority of this effort has cost significant amounts of time and resources and has almost exclusively focused on developing sorbents with increased CO2 capacity and/or reduced heat of regeneration. Given that sorbent regeneration largely dictates operational cost, this would, on the surface, appear rational. However, it is vital to recall that the cost structure of dollars per MWh of electricity generated is composed of contributions from both capital and operational costs. Consequently, this single-minded focus on equilibrium CO2 capacity and heat of regeneration excludes the contribution of transport and kinetic properties which determine the equipment size and thus the capital cost. Therefore, in order to develop sorbents which will result in a non-negligible cost reduction, it is essential to move beyond equilibrium-based metrics of sorbent performance. In this paper, we present a new methodological approach for sorbent screening which explicitly includes rate-based phenomena. Our approach uses both monetised and non-monetised performance indicators. Our results suggest that whilst equilibrium CO2 capacity is a key determinant of process performance, transport properties (e.g., viscosity) and other thermophysical properties (e.g., heat capacity) have a significant effect on the capital cost, and thus on the price of the carbon captured. The key contribution of this work is the identification of the minimum set of thermophysical and kinetic parameters which must be reported in order to justify the claim of adequacy for a new sorbent for CO2 capture in particular and gas separations in general.},

In such devices, sample mixing is essentially achieved by enhancing the diffusion effect between the different species flows. Broadly speaking, microfluidic mixing schemes can be categorized as either "active", where an external energy force is applied to perturb the sample species, or "passive", where the contact area and contact time of the species samples are increased through specially-designed microchannel configurations. Many mixers have been proposed to facilitate this task over the past 10 years. Accordingly, this paper commences by providing a high level overview of the field of microfluidic mixing devices before describing some of the more significant proposals for active and passive mixers.},

In order to understand the BOR mechanism, we performed in situ infrared reflectance spectroscopy measurements (SPAIRS technique) in 1MNaOH/1MNaBH4 with the aim to study intermediate reactions occurring on a gold electrode (a poor BH? 4 hydrolysis catalyst). We monitored several bands in B–H (1184 cm?1) and B–O bond regions (1326 and 1415 cm?1), appearing sequentially with increasing elec- trode polarisation.

This finding is unexpected and contrary to the loss of the predominant hydrogen bonding between the cation and anion, caused by the C2-methylation in the imidazolium ionic liquids. In the present study, we propose a free volume model to explain this mysterious phenomenon. For the isomeric pairs, [C(n-1)DMIm]NTf2 was found to possess less unoccupied (free) volume than [C(n)MIm]NTf2 by ∼4.5 mL mol(-1) determined by both F{\"{u}}rth's surface tension and molar volume methods, and the free volume difference can be quantitatively correlated with the C2-methylation effect on viscosity. Generally, the less free volume in [C(n-1)DMIm]NTf2 relative to [C(n)MIm]NTf2 reduces the number of the hole carriers for molecular transport with a resulting increase in viscosity. Besides, the free volume model can also be applied to account for the C2-methylation effect on other properties, such as conductivity, surface tension, density, and refractive index.},

The anion is prepared by the reaction of Py vapor with (CO(2))(m)(-) clusters carried out in an ionized, supersonic entrainment ion source. Comparison with the results of harmonic frequency calculations establishes that this species is a covalently bound molecular anion derived from the corresponding carbamate, C(5)H(5)N-CO(2)(-) (H(+)). These results confirm the structural assignment inferred in an earlier analysis of the cluster distributions and photoelectron spectra of the mixed Py(m)(CO(2))(n)(-) complexes [J. Chem.

The spectra of the (CO(2))(m)(-) (m = 5 and 7) clusters are presented for the first time in the lower energy range (1000-2400 cm(-1)), which reveal several of the fundamental modes that had only been characterized previously by their overtones and combination bands. Comparison of these new spectra with those displayed by Py(CO(2))(n)(-) suggests that a small fraction of the Py(CO(2))(n)(-) ions are trapped entrance channel reaction intermediates in which the charge remains localized on the (CO(2))(m)(-) part of the cluster.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the emergence of new measurement approaches and applications for chiral thin films and materials enabled by the observations of the high sensitivity of second-order nonlinear optical measurements to chirality. In thin films, the chiral response to second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation (SFG) from a single molecular monolayer is often comparable with the achiral response. The chiral specificity also allows for symmetry-allowed SFG in isotropic chiral media, confirming predictions made approximately 50 years ago. With these experimental demonstrations in hand, an important challenge is the construction of intuitive predictive models that allow the measured chiral response to be meaningfully related back to molecular and macromolecular structure. This review defines and considers three distinct mechanisms for chiral effects in uniaxially oriented assemblies: orientational chirality, intrinsic chirality, and isotropic chirality. The role of each is discussed in experimental and computational studies of bacteriorhodopsin films, binaphthol, and collagen. Collectively, these three model systems support a remarkably simple framework for quantitatively recovering the measured chiral-specific activity.},

abstract = {A hundred years ago, Paul Walden studied ethyl ammonium nitrate (EAN), which became the first widely known ionic liquid. Although EAN has been investigated extensively, some important issues still have not been addressed; they are now tackled in this communication. By combining experimental thermogravimetric analysis with time of flight mass spectrometry (TGA-ToF-MS) and transpiration method with theoretical methods, we clarify the volatilisation of EAN from ambient to elevated temperatures. It was observed that up to 419 K, EAN evaporates as contact-ion pairs leading to very low vapour pressures of a few Pascal. Starting from 419 K, the decomposition to nitric acid and ethylamine becomes more thermodynamically favourable than proton transfer. This finding was supported by DFT calculations, which provide the free energies of all possible gas-phase species, and show that neutral molecules dominate over ion pairs above 500 K, an observation that is in nearly prefect agreement with the experimental boiling point of 513 K. This result is crucial for the ongoing practical applications of protic ionic liquids such as electrolytes for batteries and fuel cells because, in contrast to high-boiling conventional solvents, EAN exhibits no significant vapour pressure below 419 K and this property fulfils the requirements for the thermal behaviour of safe electrolytes. Overall, EAN shows the same barely measurable vapour pressures as typical aprotic ionic liquids at temperatures only 70 K lower.},

abstract = {We have combined traditional batch and flow-through dissolution experiments, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and surface complexation modeling to re-evaluate amorphous silica reactivity as a function of solution pH and reaction affinity in NaCl and CsCl solutions. The NMR data suggest that changes in surface speciation are driven by solution pH and to a lesser extent alkali concentrations, and not by reaction time or saturation state. The 29Si cross-polarization NMR results show that the concentration of silanol surface complexes decreases with increasing pH, suggesting that silanol sites polymerize to form siloxane bonds with increasing pH. Increases in silica surface charge are offset by sorption of alkali cations to ionized sites with increasing pH. It is the increase in these ionized sites that appears to control silica polymorph dissolution rates as a function of pH. The 23Na and 133Cs NMR results show that the alkali cations form outersphere surface complexes and that the concentration of these complexes increases with increasing pH. Changes in surface chemistry cannot explain decreases in dissolution rates as amorphous silica saturation is approached. We find no evidence for repolymerization of the silanol surface complexes to siloxane complexes at longer reaction times and constant pH. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the structure of four room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) comprising the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (NTf(2)(-)) anion paired with the triethyloctylammonium (N(2228)(+)) and triethyloctylphosphonium (P(2228)(+)) cations and their isoelectronic diether analogs, the (2-ethoxyethoxy)ethyltriethylammonium (N(222(2O2O2))(+)) and (2-ethoxyethoxy)ethyltriethylphosphonium (P(222(2O2O2))(+)) cations. Agreement between simulations and experiments is good and permits a clear interpretation of the important topological differences between these systems. The first sharp diffraction peak (or prepeak) in the structure function S(q) that is present in the case of the liquids containing the alkyl-substituted cations is absent in the case of the diether substituted analogs. Using different theoretical partitioning schemes for the X-ray structure function, we show that the prepeak present in the alkyl-substituted ILs arises from polarity alternations between charged groups and nonpolar alkyl tails. In the case of the diether substituted ILs, we find considerable curling of tails. Anions can be found with high probability in two different environments: close to the cationic nitrogen (phosphorus) and also close to the two ether groups. For the two diether systems, anions are found in locations from which they are excluded in the alkyl-substituted systems. This removes the longer range (polar/nonpolar) pattern of alternation that gives rise to the prepeak in alkyl-substituted systems.},

abstract = {New classes of acidic or basic ionic liquids (ILs) are gaining special attention, since the efficiency of many processes can be enhanced by the judicious manipulation of these properties. The absorption of sour gases can be enhanced by the basic character of the IL. The fluorination of the cation or the anion can also contribute to enhance the gas solubility. In this work these two characteristics are evaluated through the study of the gas-liquid equilibrium of two ionic liquids based on similar anions, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][Ac]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate ([C4mim][TFA]), with carbon dioxide (CO2) at temperatures up to 363 K and pressures up to 76 MPa. The data reported are shown to be thermodynamically consistent. Henry's constants estimated from the experimental data show the solubility of CO2 on the [C4mim][Ac] to be spontaneous unlike in [C4mim][TFA] due to the differences in solvation enthalpies in these systems. Ab initio calculations were performed on simple intermolecular complexes of CO2 with acetate and trifluoroacetate using MP2/6-31G(d) and the G3 and G3MP2 theoretical procedures to understand the interactions between CO2 and the anions. The theoretical study indicates that although both anions exhibit a simultaneous interaction of the two oxygen of the carboxylate group with the CO2, the acetate acts as a stronger Lewis base than the trifluoroacetate. 13C high-resolution and magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectra provide further evidence for the acid/base solvation mechanism and the stability of the acetate ion on these systems. Further similarities and differences observed between the two anions in what concerns the solvation of CO2 are discussed.},

abstract = {The properties of molecular aggregates, coupled clusters of small molecules, are often challenging to unravel because of their inherent complexity and disordered environments. Their structure-function relationships are often far from obvious. However, their ability to efficiently channel excitation energy over remarkable distances, as is the case in photosynthetic light harvesting, is a compelling motivation to investigate them. Understanding and subsequently mimicking the processes in photosynthesis, for example, will set the stage for considerable advances in using light harvesting to fuel renewable energy technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy is emerging as a nonlinear optical technique that provides significant insight into the interactions and dynamics of complex molecular systems. In addition to spectrally resolving excitation and emission energies over significant bandwidths with femtosecond resolution, this technique has already enabled discoveries about the structure and dynamics of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes and other aggregates. Multiple capabilities unique to 2D electronic spectroscopy enable such findings. For example, the spectral resolution of excitation and emission combined with the ability to eliminate the effects of static disorder can reveal the homogeneous line width of a transition and the different dynamic contributions to it. Two dimensional spectroscopy is also sensitive to electronic coherence and has been employed to identify and characterize coherent excitation energy transfer dynamics in photosynthetic systems and conjugated polymers. The presence of cross-peaks, signals for which excitation and emission occur at different wavelengths, provides multiple forms of information. First, it allows the identification of states in congested spectra and reveals correlations between them. Second, we can track excitation energy flow from origin to terminus through multiple channels simultaneously. Finally, 2D electronic spectroscopy is uniquely sensitive to intermolecular electronic coupling through the sign and amplitude of the cross-peaks. This feature makes it possible to reveal spatial molecular configurations by probing electronic transitions. Another means of "resolving" these angstrom-scale arrangements is to manipulate the probing laser pulse polarizations. In this way, we can isolate and modulate specific processes in order to retrieve structural information. In this Account, we demonstrate these capabilities through a close collaboration between experiments and modeling on isolated photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes and also on J-aggregates. Each of the probed systems we describe offers insights that have both increased the utility of 2D electronic spectroscopy and led to discoveries about the molecular aggregates' dynamics and underlying structure.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical study of carbene formation from the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ionic liquid in the absence and presence of CO2 in gas and liquid phase. Although CO2 physisorption constitutes a precursory step of chemisorption (the CO2's reaction with carbenes, which forms from cations via proton abstraction by anions), it also enables a very stable CO2-anion associate. However, this counteracts the chemical absorption by reducing the basicity of the anion and the electrophilicity of the CO2, which is reflected by charge transfer. Accordingly, the observable carbene formation in the gas phase is hindered in the presence of CO2. In the neat liquid, the carbene formation is also suppressed by the charge screening compared to the case of the gas phase; nevertheless, indications for carbene incidents appear. Interestingly, in the CO2-containing liquid we detect more carbene-like incidents than in the neat one, which is caused by the way CO2 is solvated. Despite the weakness of the CO2-cation interaction, the CO2-anion associate is distorted by cations, which can be seen in longer associate distances and reduced "binding" energies. While the single solvating anion is shifted away from CO2, many more solvating cations approach it compared to the case of the gas phase. This leads to the conclusion that while the ionic liquid effect stabilizes charged species, introducing neutral species such as CO2 provides an opposite trend, leading to an inverse ionic liquid effect with the facilitation of carbene formation and thus of chemical absorption.},

abstract = {Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy can probe structural dynamics under thermal equilibrium conditions on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to approximately 100 ps and longer. One of the important uses of 2D-IR spectroscopy is to monitor the dynamical evolution of a molecular system by reporting the time dependent frequency fluctuations of an ensemble of vibrational probes. The vibrational frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) is the connection between the experimental observables and the microscopic molecular dynamics and is thus the central object of interest in studying dynamics with 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy. A new observable is presented that greatly simplifies the extraction of the FFCF from experimental data. The observable is the inverse of the center line slope (CLS) of the 2D spectrum. The CLS is the inverse of the slope of the line that connects the maxima of the peaks of a series of cuts through the 2D spectrum that are parallel to the frequency axis associated with the first electric field-matter interaction. The CLS varies from a maximum of 1 to 0 as spectral diffusion proceeds. It is shown analytically to second order in time that the CLS is the T(w) (time between pulses 2 and 3) dependent part of the FFCF. The procedure to extract the FFCF from the CLS is described, and it is shown that the T(w) independent homogeneous contribution to the FFCF can also be recovered to yield the full FFCF. The method is demonstrated by extracting FFCFs from families of calculated 2D-IR spectra and the linear absorption spectra produced from known FFCFs. Sources and magnitudes of errors in the procedure are quantified, and it is shown that in most circumstances, they are negligible. It is also demonstrated that the CLS is essentially unaffected by Fourier filtering methods (apodization), which can significantly increase the efficiency of data acquisition and spectral resolution, when the apodization is applied along the axis used for obtaining the CLS and is symmetrical about tau=0. The CLS is also unchanged by finite pulse durations that broaden 2D spectra.},

abstract = {Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a vital role in many biological processes including growth and development, immunity, and metabolism. Recent studies have highlighted zinc's dynamic role as a “cellular second messenger” in the control of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, mechanisms that contribute to dysfunctional zinc signaling are suggested to be associated with metabolic disease states including cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. The actions of the proteins that control the uptake, storage, and distribution of zinc, the zinc transporters, are under intense investigation due to their emerging role in type 2 diabetes. The synthesis, secretion, and action of insulin are dependent on zinc and the transporters that make this ion available to cellular processes. This suggests that zinc plays a previously unidentified role where changes in zinc status over time may affect insulin activity. This previously unexplored concept would raise a whole new area of research into the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and introduce a new class of drug target with utility for diabetes pharmacotherapy.},

abstract = {We have developed a systematic approach to quantitatively determine the orientational order of molecular monolayer based on surface second harmonic generation (SHG) measurement. Traditionally, the experimentally obtainable orientational parameter D=〈cos $\theta$〉/〈cos3 $\theta$〉 has been used to determine the averaged orientational angle $\theta$ with SHG. Also, it has been widely accepted that without the help from other techniques, SHG was insufficient for determination of both the orientational angle $\theta$[sub 0] and its distribution $\Delta$$\theta$. Here, we derived an explicit and general functional form, R($\theta$)=|〈cos $\theta$〉-c * 〈cos3 $\theta$〉|2, which is orientationally dependent and is proportional to the SH intensity measured from the molecular monolayer. We further showed that R($\theta$) contains the full information of the orientational order of the molecular monolayer, and the orientational parameter D represents only a special case of R($\theta$). Through orientationally sensitive R($\theta$) and D, both the orientational angle and its distribution could be uniquely and accurately determined from the SHG-only measurements in chosen polarization configurations. Using this approach, we were able to accurately determine both the orientational angle and its distribution in the Langmuir monolayer of a liquid crystal molecule 4[sup ′]-n-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) at the air/water interface. With such information, we were not only able to show that the phase transition of 8CB from the gas–liquid coexistence region to liquid region is accompanied with a continuous orientational angular distribution narrowing process, but also for the first time we were able to accurately determine a less than 3° tilt angle change of the 8CB chromophore in the whole liquid phase region of the 8CB monolayer. This quantitative approach to orientational analysis of molecular monolayer or multilayer is general for both SHG and sum frequency generation, and should lead the way to more quantitative understanding of the orientational order of molecular films per se. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Institute of Physics.

The study of the influence of the mutations on the terbium affinity showed that the residue in position 24 played a key role on the capability of the peptides to bind lanthanides and that the affinity could be enhanced by mutations on non-coordinating positions.

abstract = {We explore the intramolecular distortions present in divalent metal ion−carboxylate ion pairs using vibrational spectroscopy of the cryogenically cooled, mass-selected species isolated in the gas phase. The spectral signatures of the C−O stretching modes are identified using the perdeutero isotopologues of the acetate and propionate anions to avoid congestion arising from the CH 2 fundamentals. Both Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ are observed to bind in a symmetrical, so-called "bidentate" arrangement to the −CO 2 ¯ group. The very strong deformations of the head groups displayed by the binary complexes dramatically relax when either neutral water molecules or counterions are attached to the Mg 2+ RCO 2 ¯ cation. These results emphasize the critical role that local coordination plays when using the RCO 2 ¯ bands to deduce the metal ion complexation motif in condensed media. D ivalent metal ion binding onto carboxylate ligands is an important structural motif in biochemistry, 1−4 metal organic frameworks (MOFs), 5,6 and aerosol chemistry. 7−10 This interaction can be divided into three major classifications: bidentate, when the CO 2 ¯ interacts with the metal ion equally through both oxygen atoms (Chart 1A); monodentate, where only one oxygen atom interacts with the metal (Chart 1B); and bridging, where each oxygen atom interacts with a separate metal ion (Chart 1C). Deacon and Phillips 11 proposed an empirical rule correlating the splitting between the antisym-metric ($\nu$ as COO) and symmetric ($\nu$ s COO) stretching frequencies ($\Delta$$\nu$ as = $\nu$ as COO − $\nu$ s COO) to the local binding motif in crystalline metal acetates, which has proven valid in a limited number of simple aqueous systems. 12 The coordination environment for which spectra were recorded in solution phase studies was often not clearly defined, and structural assignments of the binding motifs relied on solid-state crystal structures of neutral species with complete coordination around the divalent metal ion from other (both charged and neutral) ligands. 11 Theoretical efforts 1,13 to understand the microscopic origin of the correlation between binding motif and $\Delta$$\nu$ as have, on the contrary, focused on isolated and hydrated (with both explicit water molecules and continuum solvation) cationic M 2+ − RCO 2 ¯ ion pairs, which, prior to this study, have not been directly measured. Such ion pairs are considered to be the most relevant species in the context of the interfacial chemistry of sea spray aerosols, where Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ are postulated to be layered below carboxylate surfactants at the air−water interface. 7−10 Here we determine the behavior of the cationic ion pairs through analysis of linear infrared action spectra of the isolated 20 K [M 2+ CD 3 CD 2 CO 2 ¯] + (M = Mg, Ca) contact ion pairs obtained using the messenger tagging IR photodissocia-tion (IRPD) technique. 14 We then explore how these binary interactions are modulated with increasing coordination of both neutral and charged ligands in the fully coordinated [Mg 2+ CD 3 CD 2 CO 2 ¯] + {\textperiodcentered}(H 2 O) 4 and [Mg 2+ (CD 3 CO 2 ¯) 3 ]¯ clusters. We focus on the CH 3 CH 2 CO 2 ¯ anion (OPr) to capture features associated with the hydrocarbon tails in surfactant spectra. 8,10,15,16 We further concentrate on its perdeuterated isotopologue CD 3 CD 2 CO 2 ¯ (d-OPr) because the C−H bending fundamentals are close to the C−O stretching fundamentals of the carboxylate group 8,10 and indeed could},

abstract = {The presence of local anisotropy in the bulk, isotropic, and ionic liquid phases—leading to local mesoscopic inhomogeneity—with nanoscale segregation and expanding nonpolar domains on increasing the length of the cation alkyl-substituents has been proposed on the basis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, there has been little conclusive experimental evidence for the existence of intermediate mesoscopic structure between the first/second shell correlations shown by neutron scattering on short chain length based materials and the mesophase structure of the long chain length ionic liquid crystals. Herein, small angle neutron scattering measurements have been performed on selectively H/D-isotopically substituted 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquids with butyl, hexyl, and octyl substituents. The data show the unambiguous existence of a diffraction peak in the low-Q region for all three liquids which moves to longer distances (lower Q), sharpens, and increases in intensity with increasing length of the alkyl substituent. It is notable, however, that this peak occurs at lower values of Q (longer length scale) than predicted in any of the previously published MD simulations of ionic liquids, and that the magnitude of the scattering from this peak is comparable with that from the remainder of the amorphous ionic liquid. This strongly suggests that the peak arises from the second coordination shells of the ions along the vector of alkyl-chain substituents as a consequence of increasing the anisotropy of the cation, and that there is little or no long-range correlated nanostructure in these ionic liquids.},

abstract = {By using a sub-5-fs visible laser pulse, we have made the first observation of the vibrational spectra of the transition state during trans-cis isomerization in the retinal chromophore of bacteriorhodopsin (bR(S68)). No instant isomerization of the retinal occurs in spite of electron promotion from the bonding pi-orbital to the anti-bonding pi*-orbital. The difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational frequencies (about 1150-1250 and 900-1000 cm(-1), respectively) is reduced during the first time period. The vibrational spectra after this period became very broad and weak and are ascribed to a "silent state." The silent state lasts for 700-900 fs until the chromophore isomerizes to the cis-C-13=C-14 conformation. The frequency of the C = C stretching mode was modulated by the torsion mode of the C-13=C-14 double bond with a period of 200 fs. The modulation was clearly observed for four to five periods. Using the empirical equation for the relation between bond length and stretching frequency, we determined the transitional C=C bond length with about 0.01 angstrom accuracy during the torsion motion around the double bond with 1-fs time resolution.},

abstract = {The management of proton conductivity in the protic ionic liquid imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Im][TFSI]) is investigated via the use of quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and pulsed-field gradient NMR. The introduction of excess neutral imidazole to [Im][TFSI] leads to enhanced conductivity. We find that proton dynamics in [Im][TFSI] with excess imidazole are characterized by proton hopping that is encompassed in the slower of two translational processes, as identified by QENS. This relatively slow process contributes to long-range diffusion more than the faster process. NMR diffusion measurements show that proton hopping decreases with increasing temperature, but significant proton hopping persists even at the maximum experimental temperature of 120 °C. This, in combination with minimal ion aggregation, leads to high proton conductivity and a high proton transference number over a wide temperature range.},

abstract = {The effective ionic radii of Shannon \& Prewitt [{\it Acta Cryst.} (1969), B{\bf 25}, 925-945] are revised to include more unusual oxidation states and coordinations. Revisions are based on new structural data, empirical bond strength-bond length relationships, and plots of (1) radii vs volume, (2) radii {\it vs} coordination number, and (3) radii {\it vs} oxidation state. Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb${\sp 5+}$-O and Mo${\sp 6+}$-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li${\sp +}$-O, Na${\sp +}$-O, and Ag${\sp +}$-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe${\sp 2+}$-X, Co${\sp 2+}$-X, Ni${\sp 2+}$-X, Mn${\sp 2+}$-X, Cu${\sp +}$-X, Ag${\sp +}$-X, and M-H${\sp -}$ bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn${\sp 2+}$-X, Cd${\sp 2+}$-X, In${\sp 2+}$-X, pb${\sp 2+}$-X, and TI${\sp +}$-X. Bonds with delocalized electrons and therefore metallic character, {\it e.g.} Sm-S, V-S, and Re-O, are significantly shorter than similar bonds with localized electrons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection, enumeration and isolation of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) have considerable potential to influence the clinical management of patients with breast cancer. There is, however, substantial variability in the rates of positive samples using existing detection techniques. The lack of standardisation of technology hampers the implementation of CTC measurement in clinical routine practice.\n\nMETHODS: This study was designed to directly compare three techniques for detecting CTCs in blood samples taken from 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and from 20 healthy controls: the CellSearch CTC System, the AdnaTest Breast Cancer Select/Detect and a previously developed real-time qRT-PCR assay for the detection of CK-19 and mammaglobin transcripts.\n\nRESULTS: As a result, 36% of patients with MBC were positive by the CellSearch System, 22% by the AdnaTest, 26% using RT-PCR for CK-19 and 54% using RT-PCR for mammaglobin. Samples were significantly more likely to be positive for at least one mRNA marker using RT-PCR than using the CellSearch System (P=0.001) or the AdnaTest (P<0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: We observed a substantial variation in the detection rates of CTCs in blood from breast cancer patients using three different techniques. A higher rate of positive samples was observed using a combined qRT-PCR approach for CK-19 and mammaglobin, which suggests that this is currently the most sensitive technique for detecting CTCs.},

abstract = {A systematic investigation of the solvent's dynamic influence on activated barrier crossings on an electronic ground state is performed using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared chemical exchange spectroscopy. These measurements facilitate a direct comparison with the widely adopted Kramers theory of condensed phase reaction kinetics, and for the first time avoid the significant complication of electronic excitation to probe directly in the time domain a ground electronic state reaction with a well-defined transition state. The picosecond timescale interconversion between two stable isomers of the metal carbonyl complex Co(2)(CO)(8) in a series of linear alkane solvents shows negligible energetic variation with solvent carbon chain length, providing an exclusive probe of the effects of solvent friction. Relative to the linear alkane series, cyclohexane does alter the potential energy surface by preferentially stabilizing one of the isomers. Despite this pronounced modification of the reaction barrier energetics, combination of experiment and computation enables the removal of the nondynamical barrier contribution to the rate constant, isolating the dynamical influence of solvent friction. The experimental data, supported with quantum and classical computations, show agreement with a simple Markovian Kramers theory for the isomerization rate constant's dependence on solvent viscosity.},

Previously, we have utilized a mixed quantum/classical model to calculate vibrational spectroscopic observables for bulk water, ice, the liquid/vapor interface, and small water clusters, as well as water interacting with ions and biological molecules. These studies rely on spectroscopic maps that relate the OH stretching frequency and transition dipole to the local environment around a water molecule. Our spectroscopic maps were parametrized based on water clusters taken from bulk water simulations; in this article, we test the robustness of these maps for water in nonbulk-liquid environments. We find that the frequency, transition dipole, and coupling maps work as well for the water surface, ice Ih, and the water hexamer as they do for liquid water. This suggests that these maps may be generally applied to study the vibrational spectroscopy of water in diverse, potentially heterogeneous environments.},

Many of the features of the Kubo theory are found in the molecular theory; indeed, the molecular theory produces microscopic expressions involving the solvent structure and dynamics for Kubo's phenomenological parameters, and provides some justification for the Gaussian assumption in the stochastic theory. On the other hand, the molecular theory produces a transition frequency time‐correlation function that is distinctly nonexponential, in contrast to the exponential assumption of the Kubo theory, and it is found that this nonexponentiality is necessary for the accurate description of line shapes in the regime intermediate between inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening. For a model of Lennard‐Jones particles the molecular theory is compared with molecular dynamicscomputer simulations.},

abstract = {Vibrational spectral diffusion denotes the time-dependent fluctuations of a solute's vibrational frequencies due to local environmental dynamics. Vibrational line shapes are weakly sensitive to spectral diffusion, whereas three-pulse vibrational echoes are much more sensitive. We report here on theoretical studies of spectral diffusion of the asymmetric stretch of the azide anion in heavy water. We run a classical molecular dynamics simulation of rigid azide in rigid water, and at every time step we calculate the azide's anharmonic asymmetric stretch frequency using an optimized quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method developed earlier. This generates a frequency trajectory, which we use to calculate the absorption line shape and integrated three-pulse echo intensity. Our results for both the line width and the integrated echo intensity are in excellent agreement with experiment. Our calculated frequency time-correlation function is in excellent agreement with experiment for long times (greater than 250 fs) but differs considerably from experiment at short times; our theoretical correlation function has a very pronounced oscillation, presumably due to intermolecular azide-water hydrogen-bond stretching dynamics.},

A review of studies on adsorption of single surfactant as well as mixtures of various types (anionic-cationic, anionic-nonionic, cationic-nonionic, cationic-zwitterionic and nonionic-nonionic) is presented here along with mechanisms involved. Results obtained using techniques such as zeta potential, flotation, AFM, specular neutron reflectivity, small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence, ESR, Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry, HPLC and ATR-IR are reviewed along with those from traditional techniques to elucidate the mechanisms of adsorption and particularly to understand synergistic/antagonistic interactions at solution/liquid interfaces and nanostructures of surface aggregates. In addition, adsorption of several mixed surfactant systems is considered due to their industrial relevance. Finally an attempt is made to derive structure-property relationships to provide a solid foundation for the design and use of surfactant formulations for industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Strong heterogeneity is found in the diffusive solvation rate. An unanticipated heterogeneity in the amplitude of the inertial solvation is also seen. Both heterogeneities exchange at the same rate. This rate is similar to the mean diffusive solvation time, putting it in the intermediate-exchange region. Overall, there are multiple violations of the assumptions usually invoked in the theory of reaction dynamics.},

We have measured the orientation of all three parts of the molecule (cyano head group, terphenyl ring, and pentyl chain) by optical second-harmonic generation and infrared-visible sum-frequency generation.

abstract = {Functional mapping and microstimulation studies suggest that recovery after stroke damage can be attributed to surviving brain regions taking on the functional roles of lost tissues. Although this model is well supported by data, it is not clear how activity in single neurons is altered in relation to cortical functional maps. It is conceivable that individual surviving neurons could adopt new roles at the expense of their usual function. Alternatively, neurons that contribute to recovery may take on multiple functions and exhibit a wider repertoire of neuronal processing. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging was used in adult mice within reorganized forelimb and hindlimb somatosensory functional maps to determine how the response properties of individual neurons and glia were altered during recovery from ischemic damage over a period of 2-8 weeks. Single-cell calcium imaging revealed that the limb selectivity of individual neurons was altered during recovery from ischemia, such that neurons normally selective for a single contralateral limb processed information from multiple limbs. Altered limb selectivity was most prominent in border regions between stroke-altered forelimb and hindlimb macroscopic map representations, and peaked 1 month after the targeted insult. Two months after stroke, individual neurons near the center of reorganized functional areas became more selective for a preferred limb. These previously unreported forms of plasticity indicate that in adult animals, seemingly hardwired cortical neurons first adopt wider functional roles as they develop strategies to compensate for loss of specific sensory modalities after forms of brain damage such as stroke.},

To explore this, six binary IL1−IL2 mixtures based on N-alkyl- N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salts have been characterized. The physicochemical properties (density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity) and phase behavior of these mixtures are reported. The variation of the alkyl chains lengths on the cations plays a significant role in determining both the phase behavior and the physicochemical properties of the mixtures. Notably, the “tunability” of the properties of the IL mixtures is much easier to control than is found by simply making small structural changes to the ions in a given salt.},

abstract = {The CO2 $\nu$3 asymmetric stretching mode is established as a vibrational chromophore for ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopic studies of local structure and dynamics in ionic liquids, which are of interest for carbon capture applications. CO2 is dissolved in a series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids ([C4C1im][X], where [X]− is the anion from the se- ries hexafluorophosphate (PF6−), tetrafluoroborate (BF4−), bis-(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylimide (Tf2N−), triflate (TfO−), trifluoroacetate (TFA−), dicyanamide (DCA−), and thiocyanate (SCN−)). In the ionic liquids studied, the $\nu$3 center frequency is sensitive to the local solvation environment and reports on the timescales for local structural relaxation. Density functional theory calculations predict charge transfer from the anion to the CO2 and from CO2 to the cation. The charge transfer drives geometrical distortion of CO2, which in turn changes the $\nu$3 frequency. The observed structural relaxation timescales vary by up to an order of magnitude between ionic liquids. Shoulders in the 2D-IR spectra arise from anharmonic coupling of the $\nu$2 and $\nu$3 normal modes of CO2. Thermal fluctuations in the $\nu$2 population stochastically modulate the $\nu$3 frequency and generate dynamic cross-peaks. These timescales are attributed to the breakup of ion cages that create a well-defined local environment for CO2. The results suggest that the picosecond dynamics of CO2 are gated by local diffusion of anions and cations.},

Solutions of the benzoic acid dimer (BA dimer), 1-benzoyl-6-hydroxy-6-phenylfulvene (Fulvene), and dibenzoylmethane (DBM) were chosen as test systems. For Fulvene in CCl(4), the PT time, $\tau$(PT), was deduced to be 7 × 10(-11) s. In the case of the BA dimer in CCl(4), the $\tau$(PT) value was considerably greater than the OH reorientational correlation time, $\tau$(R(OH)) = 4.3 × 10(-11) s. In contrast, the experimental results for DBM in CCl(4) indicated that the proton is located about midway between the two oxygen atoms, that is, the PT potential energy surface is a single well or a double well with a PT barrier near or below the zero-point energy.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derived from cellular oxygen metabolism and from exogenous sources. An excess of ROS results in oxidative stress and may eventually cause cell death. ROS levels within cells and in extracellular body fluids are controlled by concerted action of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. The essential trace element selenium exerts its antioxidant function mainly in the form of selenocysteine residues as an integral constituent of ROS-detoxifying selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx), thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) and possibly selenoprotein P (SeP). In particular, the dual role of selenoprotein P as selenium transporter and antioxidant enzyme is highlighted herein. A cytoprotective effect of selenium supplementation has been demonstrated for various cell types including neurons and astrocytes as well as endothelial cells. Maintenance of full GPx and TrxR activity by adequate dietary selenium supply has been proposed to be useful for the prevention of several cardiovascular and neurological disorders. On the other hand, selenium supplementation at supranutritional levels has been utilised for cancer prevention: antioxidant selenoenzymes as well as prooxidant effects of selenocompounds on tumor cells are thought to be involved in the anti-carcinogenic action of selenium.},

Simulations also reproduce the positive values of excess volumes and excess enthalpies, as well as their increase with temperature. The simulated viscosities are in good agreement with experimental values, especially in the water-rich region. We found three distinct regions by analyzing the concentration dependent self-diffusion coefficients via Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, indicating the mixture experiences significant microheterogeneity with the adding of water. This observation is well connected to the structure features obtained in simulations, such as radial distribution functions (RDFs), spatial distribution functions (SDFs) and water clustering analysis. At the water mole fraction (x(2)) less than 0.2, most of the water molecules are isolated in the polar cation-anion network in ionic liquids. With the increase of x(2) from 0.2 to 0.8, large water cluster forms and eventually percolates the whole system. When x(2) > 0.8, ionic liquids show a moderate degree of aggregation (with maximum around 0.9 to 0.95) before the cations and anions are fully dissolved in water.},

abstract = {Large CO2 clusters were formed by introducing room temperature gaseous mixtures of CO2 in argon into a cryogenic cell at 77 K. Rapid cooling of each mixture resulted in a highly super- saturated CO2 concentration, giving rise to homogeneous nucleation and thus cluster formation [F. F Abraham, Homogeneous Nucleation Theory, Advances in Theoretical Chemistry, Supple- ment 1 (Academic, New York, 1974), and references therein]. Experimental results will be presented here for CO2 in argon dilutions of 1:104, 1:2X 105, and 1:106. Light scattering and infrared absorption techniques have been combined to estimate an average cluster radius of 0.20 f..Lm for the 1: 104 dilution sample, and an upper limit in cluster radius of 0.10 f..Lmfor the 1:2 X 105 dilution sample. Therefore, the higher dilution CO2 :Ar mixtures led to the formation of smaller cluster sizes. Infrared structure in the vrasymmetric stretching region of the clusters will be discussed. The quantum mechanical exciton model and the classical Mie model are only par- tially successful in explaining these experimental observations. Weak absorption features have been assigned to the naturally abundant 13C160 2 and 12C160180 isotopes. The infrared structure attributed to these minority isotopes is relatively invariant with cluster size formed, and can be explained by the exciton model. This analysis suggests that, whatever overall shape the clusters have assumed, the CO2 molecules within the clusters have separations and orientations like those in the bulk crystal. Infrared spectra were collected at regular intervals over a period of 4 h for each sample. A monotonic decrease in the integrated infrared absorbance of the clusters with time was observed, with a characteristic half-life of 65, 180, and 230 min for the 1:104, 1:2X 105, and 1:106 dilution samples, respectively. The average cluster radii obtained from light scattering and infrar.ed absorption measurements have been used to calculate a sedimentation half-life of 60 and 180 min for the 1:104 and 1:2X 105 dilution samples, respectively, which agreed well with the observed disappearance times. A cluster radius of 0.09 /Lm for the 1: 106 dilution experiment is consistent with its sedimentation half-life of 230 min. I.},

abstract = {We have investigated the rotational dynamics of lithium thiocyanate (LiNCS) dissolved in various polar solvents with time and polarization resolved vibrational spectroscopy. LiNCS forms multiple distinct ionic structures in solution that can be distinguished with the CN stretch vibrational frequency of the different ionic assemblies. By varying the solvent and the LiNCS concentration, the number and type of ionic structures present in solution can be controlled. Control of the ionic structure provides control over the volume, shape, and dipole moment of the solute, critical parameters for hydrodynamic and dielectric continuum models of friction. The use of solutes with sizes comparable to or smaller than the solvent molecules also helps amplify the sensitivity of the measurement to the short-ranged solute-solvent interaction. The measured orientational relaxation dynamics show many clear and distinct deviations from simple hydrodynamic behavior. All ionic structures in all solvents exhibit multi-exponential relaxation dynamics that do not scale with the solute volume. For Lewis base solvents such as benzonitrile, dimethyl carbonate, and ethyl acetate, the observed dynamics strongly show the effect of solute-solvent complex formation. For the weak Lewis base solvent nitromethane, we see no evidence for solute-solvent complex formation, but still see strong deviation from the predictions of simple hydrodynamic theory.},

The clinical value of CTCs as a biomarker for early cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, stratification, and pharmacodynamics have been widely explored in recent years. However, the clinical utility of current CTC tests is limited mainly due to methodological constraints. In this review, the pros and cons of the reported CTC assays are comprehensively discussed. In addition, the potential of tumor cell-derived materials as new targets for CTC detection, including circulating tumor microemboli, cell fragments, and circulating DNA, is evaluated. Finally, emerging approaches for CTC detection, including telomerase-based or aptamer-based assays and cell functional analysis, are also assessed. Expectantly, a thorough review of the current knowledge and technology of CTC detection will assist the scientific community in the development of more efficient CTC assay systems.},

abstract = {Phase separation between ionic liquids (ILs) and molecular liquids is of interest physico-chemically, and also has industrial relevance. IL/water mixtures are of great interest in many fields. Unlike static phase separation between IL and water, dynamic shifts of IL/water mixtures between a homogeneous mixture and separate phases have a wide variety of applications. The miscibility of ILs with water generally increases upon heating, and a few ILs undergo a lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase transition with water in which the separated biphases become miscible upon cooling. As the phase transition is controlled by changing the temperature by a few degrees, the LCST-type phase response of IL/water mixtures makes it possible to use ILs as solvents in various energy-saving processes. Since many hydrophilic ILs do not undergo phase separation with water, we aim to determine the necessary conditions under which hydrophobic ILs undergo the phase transition. Based on physico-chemical analysis of many hydrophobic ILs that undergo a phase separation after mixing with water, we find there is a particular range of "hydrophilicity" of these hydrophobic ILs within which the LCST-type phase transition is possible. Accordingly, a hydrophilicity index (HI) of ILs is proposed, in terms of the number of water molecules in the separated IL phase. The HI value proves to be a good indicator of the phase behaviour of IL/water mixtures, as well as their phase transition temperature. Potential application of the LCST-type phase change to the selective extraction of water-soluble proteins is also summarised.},

abstract = {Electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2)---a key component of artificial photosynthesis---has largely been stymied by the impractically high overpotentials necessary to drive the process. We report an electrocatalytic system that reduces CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) at overpotentials below 0.2 volt. The system relies on an ionic liquid electrolyte to lower the energy of the (CO2)-- intermediate, most likely by complexation, and thereby lower the initial reduction barrier. The silver cathode then catalyzes formation of the final products. Formation of gaseous CO is first observed at an applied voltage of 1.5 volts, just slightly above the minimum (i.e., equilibrium) voltage of 1.33 volts. The system continued producing CO for at least 7 hours at Faradaic efficiencies greater than 96%.},

DLS results reveal the formation of RMs containing [bmim][Tf(2)N] as a polar component since the droplet size values increase as the W(s) (W(s) = [[bmim][Tf(2)N]]/[surfactant]) increases. Furthermore, it shows that the RMs consist of discrete spherical and non-interacting droplets of [bmim][Tf(2)N] stabilized by the surfactants. Important differences in the structure of [bmim][Tf(2)N] entrapped inside BHDC RMs, in comparison with the neat IL, are observed from the FT-IR and (1)H NMR measurements. The electrostatic interactions between anions and cations from [bmim][Tf(2)N] and BHDC determine the solvent structure encapsulated inside the nano-droplets. It seems that the IL structure is disrupted due to the electrostatic interaction between the [Tf(2)N](-) and the cationic BHDC polar head (BHD(+)) giving a high ion pair degree between BHD(+) and [Tf(2)N](-) at a low IL content. On the other hand, for the AOT RMs there is no evidence of strong IL-surfactant interaction. The electrostatic interaction between the SO(3)(-) group and the Na(+) counterion in AOT seems to be stronger than the possible [bmim](+)-SO(3)(-) interaction at the interface. Thus, the structure of [bmim][Tf(2)N] encapsulated is not particularly disrupted by the anionic surfactant at all W(s) studied, in contrast to the BHDC RM results. Nevertheless, there is evidence of confinement in the AOT RMs because the [bmim](+)-[Tf(2)N](-) interaction is stronger than in bulk solution. Thus, the IL is more associated upon confinement. Our results reveal that the [bmim][Tf(2)N] structure can be modified in a different manner inside RMs by varying the kind of surfactant used to create the RMs and the IL content (W(s)). These facts can be very important if these media are used as nanoreactors because unique microenvironments can be easily created by simply changing the RM components and W(s).},

abstract = {Dual frequency two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) has been used to investigate the dynamics of the azide-water solvation shell. The memory of the azide transition frequencies is detected in the echo emitted by the OH stretching mode of the ion-bound water molecules. There is a significant positive correlation of the two frequency distributions that decays on a 140 fs time scale. The result confirms that the O-H bond of water molecules in the solvent shell have frequency fluctuations that are considerably slowed from those that are known in bulk water. The positive correlation is attributed to cooperative interactions of coordinated water molecules with an azide ion.},

abstract = {The statistical thermodynamics of symmetrical “primitive‐model” electrolytes is formulated in such a way that all ions are uniquely paired. The behavior of the resulting fluid of “polar molecules” may conveniently be described by a wavelength‐dependent dielectric constant$\epsilon$(k). A rigorous formula of the Kirkwood type for $\epsilon$(k) is derived. Since ion‐atmosphere mean charge densities may be obtained from $\epsilon$(k), this dielectric function is utilized in construction of an electrolyte free‐energy expression [Eq. (50)], as well as to establish an exact second‐moment condition on the ion atmospheres [Eq. (73)]. From the latter it is demonstrated that for rigid spherical ions of diameter a, the ion atmospheres necessarily each have nonuniform charge sign when $\kappa$a > 61 / 2($\kappa$− 1 = Debye length).},

@article{Murakami1965,
abstract = {It has been made very clear by recent works of many researchers that the distribution of mechanical relaxation time in the rubbery region of a linear amorphous polymer is related closely to the shape of the molecular weight distribution. Attempts have been made to express this relation quantitatively, from a phenomenological point of view. These criteria have been considered helpful as indicators of the degree of polymer polydispersity. One is that the height of the relaxation spectrum increases with increasing sharpness of the molecular weight distribution, and this fact was previously discovered by Tobolsky and his co-workers and the indicator of the degree of polymer polydispersity in this case is here shown by Em. The other is that the relaxation spectrum approximates a “box” more closely with increasing sharpness of molecular weight distribution, and this fact was ascertained by Tobolsky and Murakami, and the indicator of the degree of polymer polydispersity in this case is here expressed by $\alpha$, and $\alpha$ is satisfied by the equation $\alpha$=$\tau$mEm/$\eta$. Some researchers have previouly studied the relation between the steady state compliance Je and the structure of polymers. According to Leaderman, Ninomiya, and others, Je appears to be dependent upon the molecular weight distribution rather than the molecular weight of polymers. The authors have succeeded in proving that Je is dependent upon the molecular weight distribution by applying procedure X developed by Murakami and Tobolsky. According to procedure X, relaxation modulus Er (t) can be written by the following equation using the distribution of relaxation time in the rubbery region. (Formula Omitted) (1) The steady state viscosity $\eta$t is shown by (Formula Omitted) (2) Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we obtain (Formula Omitted) (3) The steady state compliance Je is indicated by (Formula Omitted) (4) Substituting equation (1) into equation (4), we obtain (Formula Omitted) (5) In the region of t≫$\tau$m, equation (3) is simplified into equation (6), and equation (5) is similarly modified into equation (7), neglecting the second and more terms. $\eta$t=Em$\tau$m (6) (Formula Omitted) (7) In conclusion, equation (7) shows that the steady state compliance Je is proportional to 1/Em. Here Em is just the indicator of the polydispersity of polymers as mentioned above. To be more exact however, Je becomes $\alpha$2/Em by using the other indicator $\alpha$. The data actually obtained and the logical conclusion is thus compared. It is discussed also whether the steady state compliance Je can precisely be the parameter of the molecular weight distribution. {\textcopyright} 1965, The Society of Materials Science, Japan.

@article{Sengupta2015,
abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of molecules involved in signal transduction across cell membranes and represent major targets in the development of novel drug candidates. Membrane cholesterol plays an important role in GPCR structure and function. Molecular dynamics simulations have been successful in exploring the effect of cholesterol on the receptor and a general consensus molecular view is emerging. We review here recent molecular dynamics studies at multiple resolutions highlighting the main features of cholesterol-GPCR interaction. Several cholesterol interaction sites have been identified on the receptor that are reminiscent of nonannular sites. These cholesterol hot-spots are highly dynamic and have a microsecond time scale of exchange with the bulk lipids. A few consensus sites (such as the CRAC site) have been identified that correspond to higher cholesterol interaction. Interestingly, high plasticity is observed in the modes of cholesterol interaction and several sites have been suggested to have high cholesterol occupancy. We therefore believe that these cholesterol hot-spots are indicative of 'high occupancy sites' rather than 'binding sites'. The results suggest that the energy landscape of cholesterol association with GPCRs corresponds to a series of shallow minima interconnected by low barriers. These specific interactions, along with general membrane effects, have been observed to modulate GPCR organization. Membrane cholesterol effects on receptor structure and organization, that in turn influences receptor cross-talk and drug efficacy, represent a new frontier in GPCR research.

abstract = {In this article we determine the temperature-dependent structure of the tetradecyltrihexylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ionic liquid using a combination of X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. As in many other room-temperature ionic liquids three characteristic intermolecular peaks can be detected in the structure function S(q). A prepeak or first sharp diffraction peak is observed at about q ¼ 0.42 A 1. Long range anion-anion correlations are the most important contributors to this peak. In all systems we have studied to date, this prepeak is a signature of solvation asymmetry. The peak in S(q) near q ¼ 0.75A1 is the signature of ionic alternation and arises from the charge ordered separation of ions of the same charge. The most intense diffraction peak near q ¼ 1.37 A1 arises from short-range separation between ions of opposite charge combined with a significant contribution from cationic carbon-carbon interactions, indicating that cationic hydrophobic tails have significant contacts.},

The phase behavior of the ternary system was investigated, and microregions of [N(3111)][Tf(2)N]-in-cyclohexane (IL/O), bicontinuous, and cyclohexane-in-[N(3111)][Tf(2)N] (O/IL) were identified by traditional electrical conductivity measurements. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed the formation of the IL microemulsions. The FTIR study of O-H stretching band of TX100 also supports this finding. The dynamics of solvent and rotational relaxation have been investigated in [N(3111)][Tf(2)N]/TX100/cyclohexane microemulsions using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool and coumarin 480 (C-480) as a fluorescence probe. The size of the microemulsions increases with gradual addition of [N(3111)][Tf(2)N], which revealed from DLS measurement. This leads to the faster collective motions of cation and anions of [N(3111)][Tf(2)N], which contributes to faster solvent relaxation in microemulsions.},

The absorption line shape has a peak at $\omega$∗ = 2121 cm−1 and line width of $\Delta$$\omega$ = 127 cm−1 (FWHM). Reduced mass scaling relationships for frequency, line width, and extinction coefficient are tested by comparing to $\omega$OH and $\omega$OD absorption spectra. Harmonic scaling relationships are found to be inadequate, and deviations are discussed in terms of electrical and mechanical anharmonicity. The inverse scaling of line width with the square root of reduced mass provides further evidence that electric field fluctuations properly describe the line broadening.},

We find that the capacitance first increases with ion concentration following its expected ideal solution behavior but decreases upon approaching a pure ionic liquid. The non-monotonic behavior of the capacitance as a function of ion concentration results from the competition between the independent motion of solvated ions in the dilute regime and solvation fluctuations in the concentrated regime. When charge fluctuations induced by correlated ion-solvent fluctuations are large relative to those induced by the pure ionic liquid, such non-monotonic behavior is expected to be generic.},

abstract = {Transition dipoles are an underutilized quantity for probing molecular structures. The transition dipole strengths in an extended system like a protein are modulated by the couplings and thus probe the structures. Here we measure the absolute transition dipole strengths of human and rat amylin in their solution, aggregated, membrane, and micelleular bound forms, using a combination of 1D and 2D infrared spectroscopy. We find that the vibrational modes of amyloid fibers made of human amylin can extend across as many as 12 amino acids, reflecting very ordered beta-sheets in the most carefully prepared samples. Rat amylin has FTIR spectra that are nearly identical in solution, micelles, and membranes. We show that the transition dipoles of rat amylin are much larger when bound to micelles and membranes than when in solution, consistent with rat amylin adopting an alpha-helical structure. We interpret the transition dipole strengths as experimental measurements of the inverse participation ratio often calculated in theoretical studies. The structure of aggregating and membrane-bound proteins can be difficult to identify with existing techniques, especially during kinetics. These results demonstrate how absolute transition dipoles measured via our 1D/2D spectroscopy method can provide important structural information.},

abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids, particularly those based on substituted imidazolium cations, are currently being extensively studied for a variety of applications. Herein, we explore the suitability of several imidazolium salts in optical applications by carefully examining the electronic absorption and fluorescence behavior of these substances, generally believed to be transparent in most of the UV region and fully transparent in the visible region. It is shown that all imidazolium ionic liquids are characterized by significant absorption in the entire UV region and a long absorption tail that extends into the visible region. These absorption characteristics are attributed to the imidazolium moiety and its various associated structures. When excited in the UV or early part of the visible region, these liquids exhibit fluorescence, which covers a large part of the visible region and shows dramatic excitation wavelength dependence. The excitation wavelength dependent shift of the fluorescence maximum has been rationalized taking into consideration the existence of the various associated structures of the ionic liquids and the inefficiency of the excitation energy-transfer process between them. The results imply that these liquids may have serious drawbacks in some of the optical studies.},

The respective temperature-composition phase diagrams were constructed thus mapping the homogeneous and heterogeneous regions of the studied solutions. The impact of cation, anion and of PEG polymer chain length on the studied phase behavior was investigated and discussed in the terms of the important interactions in the solutions - hydrogen bonds and ion-dipole interactions. Imidazolium cation showed significant advantage over the phosphonium in promoting both liquid-liquid and solid-liquid solubility. On the other hand, the anion effect was found to be dependent on the outcome of the interplay between cation-anion and anion-PEG interactions. As expected, longer PEG chain led to worse solubility with the studied ionic liquids.This study is a first step to explore the possibilities to use the studied (PEG. +. ionic liquid) solutions as potential sustainable hybrid materials or combined (mixed) solvents of tunable thermophysical properties and/or solvent power. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Calcium sensor proteins translate transient increases in intracellular calcium levels into metabolic or mechanical responses, by undergoing dramatic conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding. A detailed analysis of the calcium binding-induced conformational changes in the representative calcium sensors calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C was performed to obtain insights into the underlying molecular basis for their response to the binding of calcium. Distance difference matrices, analysis of interresidue contacts, comparisons of interhelical angles, and inspection of structures using molecular graphics were used to make unbiased comparisons of the various structures. The calcium-induced conformational changes in these proteins are dominated by reorganization of the packing of the four helices within each domain. Comparison of the closed and open conformations confirms that calcium binding causes opening within each of the EF-hands. A secondary analysis of the conformation of the C-terminal domain of CaM (CaM-C) clearly shows that CaM-C occupies a closed conformation in the absence of calcium that is distinct from the semi-open conformation observed in the C-terminal EF-hand domains of myosin light chains. These studies provide insight into the structural basis for these changes and into the differential response to calcium binding of various members of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family. Factors contributing to the stability of the Ca2+-loaded open conformation are discussed, including a new hypothesis that critical hydrophobic interactions stabilize the open conformation in Ca2+ sensors, but are absent in "non-sensor" proteins that remain closed upon Ca2+ binding. A role for methionine residues in stabilizing the open conformation is also proposed.},

abstract = {Many of the unusual properties of liquid water are attributed to its unique structure, comprised of a random and fluctuating three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds that link the highly polar water molecules. One of the most direct probes of the dynamics of this network is the infrared spectrum of the OH stretching vibration, which reflects the distribution of hydrogen-bonded structures and the intermolecular forces controlling the structural dynamics of the liquid. Indeed, water dynamics has been studied in detail, most recently using multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy for acquiring structural and dynamical information on femtosecond timescales. But owing to technical difficulties, only OH stretching vibrations in D2O or OD vibrations in H2O could be monitored. Here we show that using a specially designed, ultrathin sample cell allows us to observe OH stretching vibrations in H2O. Under these fully resonant conditions, we observe hydrogen bond network dynamics more than one order of magnitude faster than seen in earlier studies that include an extremely fast sweep in the OH frequencies on a 50-fs timescale and an equally fast disappearance of the initial inhomogeneous distribution of sites. Our results highlight the efficiency of energy redistribution within the hydrogen-bonded network, and that liquid water essentially loses the memory of persistent correlations in its structure within 50 fs.},

abstract = {Histidine is often found as a ligand in metalloenzymes. The imidazole side group has two nitrogen atoms capable of being protonated or of participating in metal binding. Hence, histidine can take on various metal- bound and protonated forms in proteins. Because of its variable structural state, histidine often functions as a key amino acid residue in enzymatic reactions. Raman and IR spectroscopies have been used as powerful methods to investigate the structure of histidine in proteins. In an attempt to establish the Raman and IR markers reflecting the coordinated and protonated states of histidine, we have calculated the optimized geometry and vibrational frequencies of various forms of zinc(II) complexes of 4-methylimidazole (4-MeIm), as a model of a histidine ligand, using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The effects of metal binding on the frequency and N-deuteration shift of the C4C5 stretching mode around 1600 cm-1 and of the C5N1 stretch around 1100 cm-1 were satisfactorily reproduced in calculation and explained by changes in the bond distances and the mixing of vibrations. Additionally, the calculated frequency of the Zn-imidazole stretching mode of neutral 4-MeIm at 260-255 cm-1 exhibited an upshift by ∼25 cm-1 upon its deprotonation, being consistent with the experimental observation. Furthermore, assignments were done for the several ring vibrations in the 1510-1250 cm-1 region that have previously been used as Raman markers of the metal-bound forms. The results provided a theoretical basis for use of these markers as a basis for determining the structure of histidine in proteins. Atomic charge calculations by the natural population analysis revealed that deprotonation of the MeIm ligand decreased the charge of the Zn2+ ion and decreased the acidity of the water ligands. This suggests a possible role of the histidine ligand in controlling the catalytic reactions of metalloenzymes by changing its protonation state.},

This makes it difficult to isolate effects such as the role of Coulombic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. We have applied far-infrared and ultrafast optical Kerr effect spectroscopies on carefully selected ions with a greater or lesser degree of symmetry in order to isolate spectral signals of interest. This has allowed us to demonstrate the presence of longitudinal and transverse optical phonon modes and a great similarity of alkylammonium-based protic ionic liquids to liquid water. The data show that such phonon modes will be present in all ionic liquids, requiring a reinterpretation of their spectra.},

Cu\n                        2+ and Zn\n                        2+ bind presumably to the same site in S100B. We determined the structures of human Zn\n                        2+- and Ca\n                        2+-loaded S100B at pH 6.5, pH 9, and pH 10 by X-ray crystallography at 1.5, 1.4, and 1.65{\AA} resolution, respectively. Two Zn\n                        2+ ions are coordinated tetrahedrally at the dimer interface by His and Glu residues from both subunits. The crystal structures revealed that ligand swapping occurs for one of the four ligands in the Zn\n                        2+-binding sites. Whereas at pH 9, the Zn\n                        2+ ions are coordinated by His15, His25, His 85', and His 90', at pH 6.5 and pH 10, His90' is replaced by Glu89'.

abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) and atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analysis has been applied to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the enol conformers of malonaldehyde and its fluoro-, chloro-, cyano-, and nitro-substituted derivatives. With the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) method, good agreement between the DFT geometries and published experimental structures has been found. The donor-acceptor distance was also varied in a series of constrained optimizations in order to determine if energetic, structural, and topological trends associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonding remain valid in the intramolecular case. At very short donor-acceptor distances (<2.24 A), the hydrogen is symmetrically located between donor and acceptor; at distances longer than this, the hydrogen bonding is no longer symmetric. The AIM methodology has been applied to explore the topology of the electron density in the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the chosen model systems. Most AIM properties for intramolecular hydrogen bond distances longer than 2.24 A show smooth trends, consistent with intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Integrated AIM properties have also been used to explore the phenomenon of resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding (RAHB). It is shown that as the donor-acceptor distance is varied, pi-electron density is redistributed among the carbon atoms in the intramolecular hydrogen bond ring; however, contrary to prior studies, the integrated atomic charges on the donor-acceptor atoms were found to be insensitive to variation of hydrogen-bonding distance.},

abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are liquids consisting entirely of ions, and their important properties, e.g., negligible vapor pressure, are considered to result from the ionic nature. However, we do not know how ionic the RTILs are. The ionic nature of the RTILs is defined in this study as the molar conductivity ratio (Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR)), calculated from the molar conductivity measured by the electrochemical impedance method (Lambda(imp)) and that estimated by use of pulse-field-gradient spin-echo NMR ionic self-diffusion coefficients and the Nernst-Einstein relation (Lambda(NMR)). This ratio is compared with solvatochromic polarity scales: anionic donor ability (Lewis basicity), E(T)(30), hydrogen bond donor acidity (alpha), and dipolarity/polarizability (pi), as well as NMR chemical shifts. The Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR) well illustrates the degree of cation-anion aggregation in the RTILs at equilibrium, which can be explained by the effects of anionic donor and cationic acceptor abilities for the RTILs having different anionic and cationic backbone structures with fixed counterparts, and by the inductive and dispersive forces for the various alkyl chain lengths in the cations. As a measure of the electrostatic interaction of the RTILs, the effective ionic concentration (C(eff)), which is a dominant parameter for the electrostatic forces of the RTILs, was introduced as the product of Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR) and the molar concentration and was compared with some physical properties, such as reported normal boiling points and distillation rates, glass transition temperature, and viscosity. A decrease in C(eff) of the RTILs is well correlated with the normal boiling point and distillation rate, whereas the liquid-state dynamics is controlled by a subtle balance between the electrostatic and other intermolecular forces.},

abstract = {The freeze-quenching technique is extremely useful for trapping meta-stable intermediates populated during fast chemical or biochemical reactions. The application of this technique, however, is limited by the long mixing time of conventional solution mixers and the slow freezing time of cryogenic fluids. To overcome these problems, we have designed and tested a novel microfluidic silicon mixer equipped with a new freeze-quenching device, with which reactions can be followed down to 50 micros. In the microfluidic silicon mixer, seven 10-microm-diameter vertical pillars are arranged perpendicular to the flow direction and in a staggered fashion in the 450-pL mixing chamber to enhance turbulent mixing. The mixed-solution jet, with a cross section of 10 microm x 100 microm, exits from the microfluidic silicon mixer with a linear flow velocity of 20 m/s. It instantaneously freezes on one of two rotating copper wheels maintained at 77 K and is subsequently ground into an ultrafine powder. The ultrafine frozen powder exhibits excellent spectral quality and high packing factor and can be readily transferred between spectroscopic observation cells. The microfluidic mixer was tested by the reaction between azide and myoglobin at pH 5.0. It was found that complete mixing was achieved within the mixing dead time of the mixer (20 micros), and the first observable point for this coupled device was determined to be 50 micros, which is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than commercially available instruments.},

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one option for reducing these harmful CO2 emissions. While a variety of technologies and methods have been developed, the separation of CO2 from gas streams is still a critical issue. Apart from establishing new techniques, the exploration of capture materials with high separation performance and low capital cost are of paramount importance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of crystalline porous materials constructed by metal-containing nodes bonded to organic bridging ligands hold great potential as adsorbents or membrane materials in gas separation. In this paper, we review the research progress (from experimental results to molecular simulations) in MOFs for CO2 adsorption, storage, and separations (adsorptive separation and membrane-based separation) that are directly related to CO2 capture. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The response functions so obtained show a clearly bimodal character consisting of a subpicosecond component, which accounts for 10-40% of the response, and a much slower component relaxing over a broad range of times. The times associated with the fast component correlate with ion mass, confirming its origins in inertial solvent motions. Consistent with many previous studies, the slower component is correlated to solvent viscosity, indicating that its origins lie in diffusive, structural reorganization of the solvent. Comparisons of observed response functions to the predictions of a simple dielectric continuum model show that, as in dipolar solvents, solvation and dielectric relaxation involve closely related molecular dynamics. However, in contrast to dipolar solvents, dielectric continuum predictions systematically underestimate solvation times by factors of at least 2-4.},

The rate of frequency fluctuations reported by SCN increases with increasing temperature and decreasing alkyl chain length. Temperature- dependent correlation times scale proportionally to temperature-dependent bulk viscosities of each ionic liquid studied. A multimode Brownian oscillator model demonstrates that very low frequency (<10 cm-1) modes primarily drive the observed spectral diffusion and that these modes broaden and blue shift on average with increasing temperature. An Arrhenius analysis shows activation barriers for local motions around the probe between 5.5 and 6.5 kcal/mol that are very similar to those for transla- tional diffusion of ions. [Im6,1][Tf2N] shows an unexpected decrease in activation energy compared to [Im4,1][Tf2N] that may be related to mesoscopically ordered polar and nonpolar domains.Amodel of dynamics on a rugged potential energy landscape provides a unifying description of the observed Arrhenius behavior and the Brownian oscillator model of the lowfrequency modes.},

abstract = {Information about temporally varying molecular structure during chemical processes is crucial for understanding the mechanism and function of a chemical reaction. Using ultrashort optical pulses to trigger a reaction in solution and using time-resolved X-ray diffraction (scattering) to interrogate the structural changes in the molecules, time-resolved X-ray liquidography (TRXL) is a direct tool for probing structural dynamics for chemical reactions in solution. TRXL can provide direct structural information that is difficult to extract from ultrafast optical spectroscopy, such as the time dependence of bond lengths and angles of all molecular species including short-lived intermediates over a wide range of times, from picoseconds to milliseconds. TRXL elegantly complements ultrafast optical spectroscopy because the diffraction signals are sensitive to all chemical species simultaneously and the diffraction signal from each chemical species can be quantitatively calculated from its three-dimensional atomic coordinates and compared with experimental TRXL data. Since X-rays scatter from all the atoms in the solution sample, solutes as well as the solvent, the analysis of TRXL data can provide the temporal behavior of the solvent as well as the structural progression of all the solute molecules in all the reaction pathways, thus providing a global picture of the reactions and accurate branching ratios between multiple reaction pathways. The arrangement of the solvent around the solute molecule can also be extracted. This review summarizes recent developments in TRXL, including technical innovations in synchrotron beamlines and theoretical analysis of TRXL data, as well as several examples from simple molecules to an organometallic complex, nanoparticles, and proteins in solution. Future potential applications of TRXL in femtosecond studies and biologically relevant molecules are also briefly mentioned.},

Additionally, the temperature dependence of permeability is reported. The effect of polar ether linkages in PEO on gas transport is illustrated by comparing transport properties in PEO with those in polyethylene (PE). For example, at 35??C and infinite dilution, semi-crystalline PEO exhibits CO2 permeability coefficient of 12 Barrers, and CO 2/H2 and CO2/N2 pure gas selectivities of 6.7 and 48, respectively. In contrast, at similar conditions, the permeability of PE to CO2 is 13 Barrers, but the CO 2/N2 selectivity is only 13. In addition to good separation properties for quadrupolar-nonpolar gas pairs, PEO also shows interestingly high selectivity for olefins over paraffins, which is ascribed to favorable interaction between the polar ether groups in PEO and olefins. For example, the infinite dilution permeability of PEO to propylene is 3.8 Barrers and pure gas propylene-propane selectivity is 2.7 at 35??C. At similar conditions, PE exhibits propylene-propane selectivity of only 1.4. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The multidimensional reaction coordinate responsible for photoacidity is revealed to involve sequential activation of characteristic skeletal motions during the ca. 1 ps preparation stage preceding ESPT. The initial ring-coplanarity breaking follows in-plane ring breathing (191 cm−1), and is facilitated by HPTS ring wagging (108 cm−1) and ring-H out-of-plane motions (321, 362, 952 cm−1), which largely decay within ∼1 ps. ESPT then occurs with intrinsic inhomogeneity via various number of intervening water molecules over relatively larger distances than those in acetate–water system. The intricate relationship between the time-resolved excited-state vibrational modes of HPTS reveals the essential role of coherent low-frequency skeletal motions gating ESPT, and the multi-staged proton-transfer process having the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) value of 3–4 in aqueous solution on the 5–200 ps timescale.},

Even though the results can be described reasonably well using a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts relaxation function, rather low values of the stretching parameter beta are necessary in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. The Havriliak-Negami relaxation function leads to slightly worse agreement with experiment. The fragility parameter of the blends decreases with the concentration of PMA. The qualitative trend of the results may be interpreted in terms of the existence of concentration fluctuations in the blends. [References: 43]},

abstract = {Ionic liquids have received increasing interest in recent years for "green" synthesis and separations because they have essentially no vapor pressure. We have begun an investigation of the potential of ionic liquids for gas separations, including the removal of carbon dioxide from stack gas generated in coal-fired power plants. In this paper, we report results from measurements of the permeance of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in supported ionic liquid membranes. Preliminary results for a porous alumina membrane saturated with 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis[trifluoromethylsulfonyl] amide yielded a CO2: N2 selectivity of 127. Using previously reported measurements of CO2 solubility in ionic liquids (1) and the measured membrane transport characteristics, a preliminary economic analysis of a separation process based on supported ionic liquid membranes has been performed. A comparison of cost estimates for this membrane-based separation to cost estimates reported for carbon dioxide removal using a conventional amine scrubbing operation shows that, with continued technology development, an ionic liquid membrane process may potentially be economically competitive with amine scrubbing. A preliminary cost estimate for an ionic liquid scrubber indicates that an ionic liquid absorption process shows less favorable economics than a supported ionic liquid membrane or an amine scrubber. However, results indicate that a more comprehensive technical and economic assessment is warranted.},

abstract = {In this and the following paper, we describe the ultrafast structural fluctuations and rearrangements of the hydrogen bonding network of water using two-dimensional (2D) infrared spectroscopy. 2D IR spectra covering all the relevant time scales of molecular dynamics of the hydrogen bonding network of water were studied for the OH stretching absorption of HOD in D2O. Time-dependent evolution of the 2D IR line shape serves as a spectroscopic observable that tracks how different hydrogen bonding environments interconvert while changes in spectral intensity result from vibrational relaxation and molecular reorientation of the OH dipole. For waiting times up to the vibrational lifetime of 700fs, changes in the 2D line shape reflect the spectral evolution of OH oscillators induced by hydrogen bond dynamics. These dynamics, characterized through a set of 2D line shape analysis metrics, show a rapid 60fs decay, an underdamped oscillation on a 130fs time scale induced by hydrogen bond stretching, and a long time decay constant of 1.4ps. 2D surfaces for waiting times larger than 700fs are dominated by the effects of vibrational relaxation and the thermalization of this excess energy by the solvent bath. Our modeling based on fluctuations with Gaussian statistics is able to reproduce the changes in dispersed pump-probe and 2D IR spectra induced by these relaxation processes, but misses the asymmetry resulting from frequency-dependent spectraldiffusion. The dynamical origin of this asymmetry is discussed in the companion paper.},

abstract = {Understanding, appreciating and recognizing the influences that anomalies, artifacts and common errors have on the appearance and spectral contrast of a mid-infrared spectrum is vital if data are to be interpreted and quantified correctly. This article presents examples of some of the common imperfections that may be observed in mid-infrared spectra, and discusses concisely their origin. It covers the effects of atmospheric intrusion (water vapour and carbon dioxide), and the influences of stray light on the spectra of both liquid and solid samples. It includes a discussion of the superimposition on a spectrum of a sinusoidal waveform, such as ‘channel spectra' sometimes seen in high-resolution gas phase spectra or ‘interference fringes' observed in polymer film transmission spectra. Simple examples of spectra of common contaminants are poly(dimethyl siloxane) – silicone grease/oil-, phthalate plasticizers from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) sources – gloves, pipes -, and nitrate from non-spectroscopic grade KBr. The effects of anomalous dispersion (Christiansen effect) and scatter are illustrated for both a KBr disk and a Nujol{\textregistered} mull spectrum; the influence of anomalous dispersion and angle of incidence on attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra is also discussed, as is the overlay of a specular reflection spectrum on diffuse reflection and transflection spectra. The influence of particle size on spectral contrast for a range of sample presentation methods is illustrated. The origins of saturation effects in photoacoustic FT-IR spectra, inverted bands in emission spectra, and diffraction effects in FT-IR microscopy measurements are outlined. Other considerations include choice of single-beam background, detector non-linearity, data manipulation, plot software characteristics, instrument linearity, and external reflection mixed-mode spectra.},

abstract = {The lack of general spectroscopic probes that can be used in a range of systems to probe kinetics and dynamics is a major obstacle to the widespread application of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. We have studied 3-azidopyridine to characterize its potential as a probe of the protonation state of the pyridine ring. We find that the azido-stretching vibration is split by accidental Fermi resonance interactions with one or more overtones and combination states. Using 2D IR spectroscopy, we determine the state structure of the resulting eigenstates for complexes of 3-azidopyridine with formic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in which the pyridine ring is unprotonated and protonated, respectively. Based on the measurements, we develop a two-oscillator depurturbation model to determine the energies and couplings of the zeroth-order azido-stretching state and the perturbing dark state that couples to it. Based on these results, we conclude that the azido-stretching vibration is, in fact, sensitive to the protonation state of the pyridine shifting up in frequency by 8 cm(-1) in the complex with trifluoroacetic acid relative to the formic acid complex. These results suggest that, although 3-azidopyridine is not suitable as a spectroscopic probe, the approach of employing an organic azide as a remote probe of protonation state holds significant promise.},

Experimentally it has been observed that the substitution of a methyl group for a hydrogen at the C2 position of the cation ring leads to an increase in both the melting point and liquid phase viscosity, contrary to arguments that had been made regarding associations between the ions. The melting points of the four ionic liquids were accurately predicted using simulations, as were the trends in viscosity. The simulation results show that the origin of the effect is mainly entropic, although enthalpy also plays an important role.},

Photochemical activity of both complexes is lost in water but is retained in 1 M H2O in DMF. Controlled current electrolysis of a solution of Ru$\beta$ in CO2 saturated DMF:H2O (1 M) yields predominantly methanol over a 6 h period at ∼ -0.60 V versus Ag/AgCl, with traces of formaldehyde. After this time, the potential jumped to -1.15 V producing both methanol and CO as products. Irradiation of Ru$\beta$ in a solution of DMF:H2O (1 M) containing 0.2 M TEA (as the sacrificial reductant) yields methanol, formaldehyde, and formate. Identifications of all of the relevant redox and protonated states of the respective complexes were obtained by a combination of voltammetry and differential reflectance measurements. Spectroelectrochemistry was particularly useful to probe the photochemical and electrochemical reduction mechanisms of both complexes as well as the complexes speciation in the absence and presence of CO2.},

abstract = {Water is essential for life in many ways, and without it biomolecules might no longer truly be biomolecules. In particular, water is important to the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of biological macromolecules. In protein folding, water mediates the collapse of the chain and the search for the native topology through a funneled energy landscape. Water actively participates in molecular recognition by mediating the interactions between binding partners and contributes to either enthalpic or entropic stabilization. Accordingly, water must be included in recognition and structure prediction codes to capture specificity. Thus water should not be treated as an inert environment, but rather as an integral and active component of biomolecular systems, where it has both dynamic and structural roles. Focusing on water sheds light on the physics and function of biological machinery and self-assembly and may advance our understanding of the natural design of proteins and nucleic acids.},

abstract = {The present work reports the imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) assisted enhancement in activity of water-pool solubilized enzyme trypsin in cationic reverse micelles of CTAB. A set of imidazolium ILs (1-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromides) were prepared with varying lengths of their side arm which results in the differential location of these organic salts in the reverse micelles. The different ILs offered varied activating effects on the biocatalyst. The activity of trypsin improved approximately 30-300% in the presence of 0.1-10 mM of different ILs in reverse micelles of CTAB. Trypsin showed approximately 300% (4-fold) increment in its activity in the presence of IL 2 (1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide, EMIMBr) compared to that observed in the absence of IL in CTAB reverse micelles. The imidazolium moiety of the IL, resembling the histidine amino acid component of the catalytic triad of hydrolases and its Br(-) counterion, presumably increases the nucleophilicity of water in the vicinity of the enzyme by forming a hydrogen bond that facilitates the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester. However, the ILs with increasing amphiphilic character had little to no effect on the activity of trypsin due to their increased distance from the biocatalyst, as they tend to get localized toward the interfacial region of the aggregates. Dynamic light scattering experimentation was carried out in the presence of ILs to find a possible correlation between the trypsin activity and the size of the aggregates. In concurrence with the observed highest activity in the presence of IL 2, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of trypsin in CTAB reverse micelles doped with IL 2 exhibited the lowest mean residue ellipticity (MRE), which is closest to that of the native protein in aqueous buffer.},

It was found that the tuning of emission color of the isophorone-based compounds in the solid state could be conveniently accomplished by changing the terminal substituent group. The photophysical properties in solution, aqueous suspension, and crystalline state, along with their relationships, are comparatively investigated. Crystallographic data of 1-4 indicate that the existence of multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the adjacent molecules restricts the intramolecular vibration and rotation and enables compounds 1-4 to emit intensely in the solid state. The size and growth processes of particles with different water fractions were studied using a scanning electron microscope, indicating that smaller globular nanoparticles in aqueous suspension are in favor of fluorescence emissions. The above results suggest that substituent groups have a great influence on their molecular packing, electronic structure, and aggregation-induced emission properties.

The anions are the bromide and the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ion. All the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salts as well as the bromide salts with a long alkyl spacer were obtained as viscous liquids at room temperature, but some turned out to be supercooled liquids. In addition, pyrrolidinium and piperidinium ionic liquids with two nitrile functions attached to the heterocyclic core have been prepared. The crystal structures of seven pyridinium bis- (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salts are reported. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed on model cations and ion pairs with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion. A continuum model has been used to take solvation effects into account. These calculations show that the natural partial charge on the nitrogen atom of the nitrile group becomes more negative when the length of the alkyl spacer between the nitrile functional group and the heterocyclic core of the cation is increased. Methyl or methoxy substituents on the pyridinium ring slightly increase the negative charge on the nitrile nitrogen atom due to their electron-donating abilities. The position of the substituent (ortho, meta, or para) has only a very minor effect on the charge of the nitrogen atom. The 15N NMR spectra of the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquids were recorded with the nitrogen-15 nucleus at its natural abundance. The chemical shift of the 15N nucleus of the nitrile nitrogen atom could be correlated with the calculated negative partial charge on the nitrogen atom.},

abstract = {A gateless lateral p-n junction with reconfigurability is demonstrated on graphene by ion-locking using solid polymer electrolytes. Ions in the electrolytes are used to configure electric-double-layers (EDLs) that induce p-and n-type regions in graphene. These EDLs are locked in place by two different electrolytes with distinct mechanisms: (1) a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based electrolyte, PEO:CsClO4, is locked by thermal quenching (i.e., operating temperature < Tg (glass transition temperature), and (2) a custom-synthesized, doubly-polymerizable ionic liquid (DPIL) is locked by thermally triggered polymerization that enables room temperature operation. Both approaches are gateless because only the source/drain terminals are required to create the junction, and both show two current minima in the backgated transfer measurements, which is a signature of a graphene p-n junction. The PEO:CsClO4 gated p-n junction is reconfigured to n-p by resetting the device at room temperature, reprogramming, and cooling to T < Tg. These results show an alternate approach to locking EDLs on 2D devices and suggest a path forward to reconfigurable, gateless lateral p-n junctions with potential applications in polymorphic logic circuits.},

For all three liquid crystals, the data decay exponentially only on the longest time scale (> several ns). The temperature dependence of the long time scale exponential decays is described well by the Landau–de Gennes theory of the randomization of pseudonematic domains that exist in the isotropic phase of liquid crystals near the isotropic to nematic phase transition. At short time, all three liquid crystals display power law decays. Over the full range of times, the data for all three liquid crystals are fit with a model function that contains a short time power law. The power law exponents for the three liquid crystals range between 0.63 and 0.76, and the power law exponents are temperature independent over a wide range of temperatures. Integration of the fitting function gives the empirical polarizability–polarizability (orientational) correlation function. A preliminary theoretical treatment of collective motions yields a correlation function that indicates that the data can decay as a power law at short times. The power law component of the decay reflects intradomain dynamics.},

The specific surfaces considered resemble the 100 and 111 faces of platinum. Several results emerge that should apply generally, not just to platinum. These results are generic consequences of water molecules binding strongly to surfaces that are incommensurate with favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns. We show that adlayers of water under these conditions have frustrated structures that interact unfavorably with adjacent liquid water. We elucidate dynamical processes of water in these cases that extend over a broad range of timescales, from less than picoseconds to more than nanoseconds. Associated spatial correlations extend over nanometers. We show that adlayer reorganization occurs intermittently, and each reorganization event correlates motions of several molecules. We show that soft liquid interfaces form adjacent to the adlayer, as is generally characteristic of liquid water adjacent to a hydrophobic surface. The infrequent adlayer reorganization produces a hydrophobic heterogeneity that we characterize by studying the degrees by which different regions of the adlayers attract small hydrophobic particles. Consequences for electrochemistry are discussed in the context of hydronium ions being attracted from the liquid to the metal-adlayer surface.},

Anion-anion correlations (Figure S1) are much more varied due to the differing symmetries of the anions examined, typically giving rise to multiple peaks in their g(r). However, this has surprisingly little overall effect on the development of the solvophobic nanostructure (Figure 3). The similarities already noted between EAN and PAN are again evident in the nitrate stacking behaviour (Figure S1E\&F), which gives them an unusually small nearest-neighbour distance (Figure S1A). The difference between nitrate and formate is especially striking in this context. Both the g(r) and sdf results show that formate forms no such stacks in EAF, but instead appears to form chains of dimer-like structures, reminiscent of arrangements in formic acid, 67 but more swollen as they are not stabilized by anion-anion H-bonding. Like EAN and PAN, EASCN and BASCN have similar g X{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}X (r), but with the largest nearest-neighbour separations of all the PILs examined.},

abstract = {Until recently, the rapid time scales associated with the formation of an adsorbed surfactant layer at the solid-aqueous interface has prevented accurate investigation of adsorption kinetics. This has led to the mechanism of surfactant adsorption being inferred from thermodynamic data. These explanations have been further hampered by a poor knowledge of the equilibrium adsorbed surfactant morphology, with the structure often misinterpreted as simple monolayers or bilayers, rather than the discrete surface aggregates that are present in many surfactant-substrate systems. This review aims to link accepted equilibrium data with more recent kinetic and structural information in order to describe the adsorption process for ionic surfactants. Traditional equilibrium data, such as adsorption isotherms obtained from depletion approaches, and the most popular methods by which these data are interpreted are examined. This is followed by a description of the evidence for discrete aggregation on the substrate, and the morphology of these aggregates. Information gained using techniques such as atomic force microscopy, fluorescence quenching and neutron reflectivity is then reviewed. With this knowledge, the kinetic data obtained from relatively new techniques with high temporal resolution, such as ellipsometry and optical reflectometry, are examined. On this basis the likely mechanisms of adsorption are proposed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have developed a Fourier transform two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectrometer to probe chemical reactions and biophysical processes triggered by a nanosecond temperature jump (T jump). The technical challenges for such a spectrometer involve (1) synchronization of a nanosecond T-jump laser and femtosecond laser system, (2) overcoming the decreased signal-to-noise ratio from low repetition rate data acquisition, and (3) performing an interferometric measurement through a sample with a density and index of refraction that varies with time delay after the T jump. The first challenge was overcome by synchronizing the two lasers to a clock derived from the Ti:sapphire oscillator, leading to timing accuracy of 2ns for delays up to 50ms. The data collection time is reduced by using undersampling with the improved signal-to-noise ratio obtained from a balanced detection scheme with a dual stripe array detector. Transient dispersed vibrational echo and 2D IR spectroscopy are applied to N-methylacetamide and ubiquitin, as examples, and the spectral responses by a temperature elevation and by structural changes of the protein are compared. The synchronization of 2D IR spectroscopy with a nanosecond temperature jump without losing its sensitivity at a low repetition rate opens a new applicability of the nonlinear spectroscopy to probe a variety of molecular structure changes induced by a nanosecond perturbation.},

We report a microscopic model for the interaction between the surfactant and water and between water molecules at the interface, revealed using static and timeresolved two-dimensional sum frequency generation spectroscopy. Two distinct subensembles of water in the presence of this negatively charged SDS surfactant have been identified: those close to the SDS headgroup having fairly isolated O−H groups, i.e., localized O−H stretch vibrations, and those whose O−H stretch vibrations are delocalized, i.e., shared between multiple O−H bonds. The two subensembles are coupled, with subpicosecond energy transfer occurring between them. This is markedly different from O−H bonds at the air−water interface, which are less heterogeneous, and indicates that the water molecules that interact with the surfactant headgroups have hydrogen-bonding properties different from those of water molecules interacting with the other water molecules.},

abstract = {We explore the capability of the azidohomoalanine (Aha) as a vibrational label for 2D IR spectroscopy to study the binding of the target peptide to the PDZ2 domain. The Aha label responds sensitively to its local environment and its peak extinction coefficient of 350-400 M(-1) cm(-1) is high enough to routinely measure it in the low millimolar concentration regime. The central frequency, inhomogeneous width and spectral diffusion times deduced from the 2D IR line shapes of the Aha label at various positions in the peptide sequence is discussed in relationship to the known X-ray structure of the peptide bound to the PDZ2 domain. The results suggest that the Aha label introduces only a small perturbation to the overall structure of the peptide in the binding pocket. Finally, Aha is a methionine analog that can be incorporated also into larger proteins at essentially any position using protein expression. Altogether, Aha thus fulfills the requirements a versatile label should have for studies of protein structure and dynamics by 2D IR spectroscopy.},

The isomerization time constant is 43 picoseconds (ps, 10–12 s).

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) with aprotic heterocyclic anions (AHA) are attractive candidates for CO2 capture technologies. In this study, a series of AHA ILs with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([emim]+) cations were synthesized, and their physical properties (density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity) were measured. In addition, CO2 solubility in each IL was determined at room temperature using a volumetric method at pressures between 0 and 1 bar. The AHAs are basic anions that are capable of reacting stoichiometrically with CO2 to form carbamate species. An interesting CO2 uptake isotherm behavior was observed, and this may be attributed to a parallel, equilibrium proton exchange process between the imidazolium cation and the basic AHA in the presence of CO2, followed by the formation of “transient” carbene species that react rapidly with CO2. The presence of the imidazolium-carboxylate species and carbamate anion species was verified using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. While the reaction between CO2 and the proposed transient carbene resulted in cation-CO2 binding that is stronger than the anion-CO2 reaction, the reactions of the imidazolium AHA ILs were fully reversible upon regeneration at 80 °C with nitrogen purging. The presence of water decreased the CO2 uptake due to the inhibiting effect of the neutral species (protonated form of AHA) that is formed.},

These data, combined with available literature data, are used to try to uncover the solute and solvent characteristics most important in determining tracer diffusion rates. Discussion is framed in terms of departures from simple hydrodynamic predictions for translational friction using the ratio $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE, where $\zeta$obs is the observed friction, determined from the measured diffusion coefficient D via $\zeta$obs = kBT/D, and $\zeta$SE = 6$\pi$$\eta$R is the Stokes friction on a sphere of radius R (determined from the solute van der Waals volume) in a solvent with viscosity $\eta$. In the case of neutral solutes, the primary determinant of whether hydrodynamic predictions are accurate is the relative size of solute versus solvent molecules. A single correlation, albeit with considerable scatter, is found between $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE and the ratio of solute-to-solvent van der Waals volumes, $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE = {1 + a(VU/VV)(-p)}, with constants a = 1.93 and p = 1.88. In the case of small solutes, the observed friction is over 100-fold smaller than predictions of hydrodynamic models. The dipole moment of the solute has little effect on the friction, whereas solute charge has a marked effect. For monovalent solutes of size comparable to or smaller than the solvent ions, the observed friction is comparable to or even greater than what is predicted by hydrodynamics. These general trends are shown to be quite similar to what is observed for tracer diffusion in conventional solvents.},

abstract = {Parvalbumins are a class of calcium-binding proteins characterized by the presence of several helix-loop-helix (EF-hand) motifs. It is suspected that these proteins evolved via intragene duplication from a single EF-hand. Silver hake parvalbumin (SHPV) consists of three EF-type helix-loop-helix regions, two of which have the ability to bind calcium. The three helix-loop-helix motifs are designated AB, CD, and EF, respectively. In this study, native silver hake parvalbumin isoform B (SHPV-B) has been sequenced by mass spectrometry. The sequence indicates that this parvalbumin is a $\beta$-lineage parvalbumin. SHPV-B was cleaved into two major fragments, consisting of the ABCD and EF regions of the native protein. The 33-amino acid EF fragment (residues 76-108), containing one of the calcium ion binding sites in native SHPV-B, has been isolated and studied for its structural characteristics, ability to bind divalent and trivalent cations, and for its propensity to undergo metal ion-induced self-association. The presence of Ca2+ does not induce significant secondary structure in the EF fragment. However, NMR and CD results indicate significant secondary structure promotion in the EF fragment in the presence of the higher charge-density trivalent cations. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis results show that the EF fragment exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium when complexed with La3+.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the slow dynamics of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, a very popular room-temperature ionic solvent. Our study predicts the existence of heterogeneity in the liquid and shows that this heterogeneity is the underlying microscopic cause for the recently reported "red-edge effect" (REE) observed in the study of fluorescence of the organic probe 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene. This theoretical work explains in microscopic terms the relation between REE and dynamic heterogeneity in a room-temperature ionic liquid (IL). The REE is typical of micellar or colloidal systems, which are characterized by microscopic environments that are structurally very different. In contrast, in the case of this room-temperature IL, the REE occurs because of the long period during which molecules are trapped in quasistatic local solvent cages. This trapping time, which is longer than the lifetime of the excited-state probe, together with the inability of the surroundings to adiabatically relax, induces a set of site-specific spectroscopic responses. Subensembles of fluorescent molecules associated with particular local environments absorb and emit at different frequencies. We describe in detail the absorption wavelength-dependent emission spectra of 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene and show that this dependence on lambda(ex) is characteristic of the IL and, as is to be expected, is absent in the case of a normal solvent such as methanol.},

abstract = {In this thesis, dynamics experiments are developed that can be used to study protein conformational changes such as folding and binding. Every functional motion of a protein is inextricably linked to conformational dynamics. However, most of our insight into protein folding and binding is indirectly obtained through kinetics experiments that measure reaction rates and reveal how fast populations of stable states interconvert. Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) is the central tool developed in this thesis for protein dynamics experiments due to its combination of time and structural resolution. As a vibrational spectroscopy, 2D IR potentially offers femtosecond time resolution. Its advantages over linear, absorption spectroscopy come through correlating excitation and emission frequencies to allow for a separation of homogenous and inhomogeneous line shape components, and to give rise to structurally sensitive cross-peaks. One general problem was repeatedly addressed in this thesis: how can 2D IR spectra best be modeled to reveal atomistic structural information? The key feature that now sets 2D IR apart from other fast protein probes is that the data can readily be calculated from an atomistic structure or molecular dynamics simulation using the methods developed in this thesis work. Demonstrative applications are presented for the amide 1-11 spectroscopy of NMA, the amide 1'-II' spectroscopy of poly-L-lysine, isotope-edited 2D IR spectroscopy of trpzip2, and transient 2D JR spectroscopy of ubiquitin unfolding after a temperature jump. The emerging paradigm is to interpret 2D IR spectra with the aid of an atomistic, molecular dynamics simulation. The applications to protein binding use the monomer-dimer transition of insulin as a model system. Using a combination of experiments and simulations, this equilibrium was characterized as a function of protein concentration, temperature, and solvent. Finally, as a complement to the structural information provided by 2D IR, dye-labeling and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence experiments on insulin are described.},

abstract = {In the last few years, various studies have been providing evidence that metal ions are critically involved in the pathogenesis of major neurological diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson). Metal ion chelators have been suggested as potential therapies for diseases involving metal ion imbalance. Neurodegeneration is an excellent target for exploiting the metal chelator approach to therapeutics. In contrast to the direct chelation approach in metal ion overload disorders, in neurodegeneration the goal seems to be a better and subtle modulation of metal ion homeostasis, aimed at restoring ionic balance. Thus, moderate chelators able to coordinate deleterious metals without disturbing metal homeostasis are needed. To date, several chelating agents have been investigated for their potential to treat neurodegeneration, and a series of 8-hydroxyquinoline analogues showed the greatest potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a "proton wire," while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.},

abstract = {The set of synthetic polytripeptides and polyhexapeptides which can adopt a triple helical form constitutes a good model system for investigating collagen structure. Previous a new infrared spectroscopic studies are considered on collagen and the infrared spectra of a number of polymers with collagen like features are presented. The amide A band position for all triple helical polypeptides is higher than that observed for most proteins and polypeptides and this high frequency appears to be related to the degree of supercoiling of the triple helix. It is possible that with increased supercoiling of the three chains, the angles between the groups involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bonds become less favourable, or these bonds may become unusually long. The frequency of the amide I band varies considerably for triple helical polypeptides with different amino acid sequences, and often minor bands are observed. This finding contrasts with the observations for polypeptides in a pleated sheet or $\alpha$ helical form, where the same amide I frequency is observed regardless of the amino acid composition. An explanation for this variation is proposed in terms of the hydrogen bonding properties of amino acids. Significant spectral changes in the amide I region are observed on hydration in the spectra of some triple helical polypeptides, but corresponding changes have not been found in the collagens examined.},

SFG spectra of hydrogen on polycrystal and single crystal platinum electrodes in acid medium are measured both in the under-and in the overpotential region. The vibrational fingerprints of the underpotential deposited hydrogen are structure sensitive and are related to its bonding to interfacial water molecules. On Pt(111) electrode, we have detected adsorbed hydrogen at potential as high as 0.35 V, within the so-called unusual adsorption state. A new hydrogen adspecies shows up in the overpotential range. Its vibrational signature is not dependent on the electrode surface orientation and we have assigned it to the intermediate of hydrogen evolution.},

The amide I band is widely used in infrared spectroscopy of proteins due to the large signal intensity, high sensitivity to hydrogen bonding, and secondary structural motifs. This band has, thus, proven valuable in many studies of protein structure–function relationships. We benchmark spectral simulation protocols using two common force fields in combination with several electrostatic mappings and coupling models. The results are validated against experimental linear absorption and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy for three well-studied proteins. We find two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to be much more sensitive to the simulation protocol than linear absorption and report on the best simulation protocols. The findings demonstrate that there is still room for ideas to improve the existing models for the amide I band of proteins.},

However, surface molecules of the monolayers can adopt conformations with many different orientations. Thus, it is necessary to describe the orientations of surface molecular monolayers using both mean tilt angle and orientational distribution, which together we refer to as orientation heterogeneity. Orientation heterogeneity is difficult to measure. In most cases, in order to calculate the mean tilt angle, it is assumed that the orientational distribution is narrow. This assumption causes ambiguities in determining the mean tilt angle and loss of orientational distribution information, which is known as the “magic angle” challenge.

abstract = {Photochemical catalytic CO2 reduction to formate and methanol has been demonstrated in an aqueous homogeneous system at pH 5.0 comprising ruthenium(II) trisphenanthroline as the chromophore, pyridine as the CO2 reduction catalyst, KCl, and ascorbic acid as a sacrificial reductant, using visible light irradiation at 470 ± 20 nm. Isotopic labeling with (13)CO2 yields the six-electron-reduced product (13)CH3OH. After 1 h photolysis, the two-electron-reduced product formate and the six-electron-reduced product methanol are produced with quantum yields of 0.025 and 1.1 × 10(–4), respectively. This represents 76 and 0.15 turnovers per Ru for formate and methanol, respectively, and 152 and 0.9 turnovers per Ru on an electron basis for formate and methanol, respectively. The system is inactive after 6 h irradiation, which appears largely to be due to chromophore degradation. A partial optimization of the methanol yield showed that high pyridine to Ru ratios are needed (100:1) and that the optimum pH is near 5.0. The presence of potassium salts enhances the yield in formate and methanol by 8- and 2-fold, respectively, compared to electrolyte-free solutions; however, other alkali and alkali earth cations have little effect. The addition of small amounts of solid metal catalysts immobilized on carbon had either no effect (M = Pt or Pd) or deleterious effects (M = Ni or Au) on methanol production. Addition of colloidal Pt resulted in no methanol production at all. This is in notable contrast with the pyridine-based electrocatalysis of CO2 to methanol in which metallic or conductive surfaces such as Pt, Pd, or p-type GaP are necessary for methanol formation.},

abstract = {Surface-bound polypeptides and proteins are increasingly used to functionalize inorganic interfaces such as electrodes, but their structural characterization is exceedingly difficult with standard technologies. In this paper, we report the first two-dimensional sum-frequency generation (2D SFG) spectra of a peptide monolayer, which are collected by adding a mid-IR pulse shaper to a standard femtosecond SFG spectrometer. On a gold surface, standard FTIR spectroscopy is inconclusive about the peptide structure because of solvation-induced frequency shifts, but the 2D line shapes, anharmonic shifts, and lifetimes obtained from 2D SFG reveal that the peptide is largely $\alpha$-helical and upright. Random coil residues are also observed, which do not themselves appear in SFG spectra due to their isotropic structural distribution, but which still absorb infrared light and so can be detected by cross-peaks in 2D SFG spectra. We discuss these results in the context of peptide design. Because of the similar way in which the spectra are collected, these 2D SFG spectra can be directly compared to 2D IR spectra, thereby enabling structural interpretations of surface-bound peptides and biomolecules based on the well-studied structure/2D IR spectra relationships established from soluble proteins.},

abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy is an essential tool in chemical analyses, biological assays, and studies of functional materials. Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository Web site (http://frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future.},

abstract = {Vibrational Stark effects, which are the effects of electric fields on vibrational spectra, were measured previously for the C−N stretch mode of several small nitriles, yielding difference dipole moments, difference polarizabilities, and transition polarizabilities for each species [Andrews, S. S.; Boxer, S. G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 11 853]. This paper explains the physical origins of the observed Stark effects using two theoretical models and, in the process, computes several molecular parameters for each nitrile. A model with a single vibrational mode, developed with perturbation theory, is found to explain most of the experimental Stark effects. Because it cannot account for coupling between modes, which is ubiquitous and important for resonant vibrations and for combination mode absorption, another model is developed which considers multiple vibrational modes and three spatial degrees of freedom. It is found that difference dipole moments arise from a combination of mechanical anharmonicity and electronic perturbations of chemical bonds, where the two factors have about equal magnitudes for nitriles. Transition polarizabilities are dominated by the effects of electronic polarizability of the sample molecule, which alters the partial charges on atoms in an electric field. Stark effects of resonant transitions are found to be equal to linear combinations of the effects for the basis states, which explains an experimental observation. For overtone and combination transitions, Stark shifts are predicted to be the sums of the shifts of the component transitions. Absolute overtone intensities can be calculated from difference dipole results, which is experimentally verified. In summary, these theories largely explain the physical origins of observed vibrational Stark effects and can predict Stark effects for a wide variety of other systems.},

abstract = {Ultrafast two-photon photoemission has been used to study electron solvation at two-dimensional metal/polar-adsorbate interfaces. The molecular motion that causes the excess electron solvation is manifested as a dynamic shift in the electronic energy. Although the initially excited electron is delocalized in the plane of the interface, interactions with the adsorbate can lead to its localization. A method for determining the spatial extent of the localized electron in the plane of the interface has been developed. This spatial extent was measured to be on the order of a single adsorbate molecule.},

abstract = {We combine classical and ring polymer molecular dynamics simulations with the molecular jump model to provide a molecular description of the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on water reorientation and hydrogen-bond dynamics in liquid H2O and D2O. We show that while the net NQE is negligible in D2O, it leads to a ∼13% acceleration in H2O dynamics compared to a classical description. Large angular jumps—exchanging hydrogen-bond partners—are the dominant reorientation pathway (just as in a classical description); the faster reorientation dynamics arise from the increased jump rate constant. NQEs do not change the jump amplitude distribution, and no significant tunneling is found. The faster jump dynamics are quantitatively related to decreased structuring of the OO radial distribution function when NQEs are included. This is explained, via a jump model analysis, by competition between the effects of water's librational and OH stretch mode zero-point energies on the hydrogen-bond strength.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids have been explored as attractive alternative media for CO2 separation not only due to their low volatility but also due to their highly tuneable nature. Aiming at designing highly efficient liquid phases for flue gas separation and natural gas purification, this work focuses on the use of binary ionic liquid mixtures containing sulfate and/or cyano-functionalized anions. Several mixtures were prepared and their gas transport properties through supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) were investigated. The thermophysical properties of these mixtures, namely viscosity and density (data presented and discussed in ESI), were also measured so that trends between transport properties and thermophysical properties could be evaluated. The results obtained indicate that depending on the anions mixed, membranes with fine-tuned gas permeabilities, diffusivities and solubilities can be obtained. Additionally, SILMs prepared with these ionic liquid mixtures are on the upper bound of the CO2/N2 separation, or even may surpass it, indicating their potential for separating CO2 in low-pressure post-combustion processes. Overall, the use of ionic liquid mixtures combining the most selective anions with the least viscous anions is a highly promising strategy to design advanced engineered liquid phases for CO2 separation membranes.},

However, the delivery of nano-sized agents into cancer tissue is problematic because it mostly relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that depends on the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the prolonged circulation of nano-sized agents, allowing slow but uneven accumulation in the tumor bed. Delivery of nano-sized agents is dependent on several factors that influence the EPR effect; 1. Regional blood flow to the tumor, 2. Permeability of the tumor vasculature, 3. Structural barriers imposed by perivascular tumor cells and extracellular matrix, 4. Intratumoral pressure. In this review, these factors will be described and methods to enhance nano-agent delivery will be reviewed.},

We provide the first experimental evidence of the existence of nanoscale heterogeneities in neat liquid and supercooled RTILs, such as 1-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium-based salts, using X-ray diffraction. These heterogeneities are of the order of a few nanometers and their size is proportional to the alkyl chain length. These results provide strong support to the findings from recent molecular dynamics simulations, which proposed the occurrence of nanostructures in RTILs, as a consequence of alkyl chains segregation. Moreover, our study addresses the issue of the temperature dependence of the heterogeneities size, showing a behavior that resembles the density one only below the glass transition, thus suggesting a complex behavior above this temperature. These results will provide a novel interpretation approach for the unique chemical physical properties of RTILs.},

The heterogeneous microstructures of the blend membranes (PU /PA12-b-PTMG) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Gas transport properties were determined for O2, N2, CH4, and CO2 gases and the obtained permeabilities were correlated with polymer properties and morphology of the membranes. Comparison of the results with that of the pure PU membrane indicates that the blend membranes had higher permeability to CO2, but lower permeability to O2, N2 and CH4 gases, and, therefore, had higher values of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 ideal gas pair selectivities. The blend membrane with 20 % (wt) PA12-b-PTMG showed the highest CO2 permeability (≈105 Barrer) compared to the PU and other blend membranes. In the blend membranes with 5–20 % (wt) PA12-b-PTMG contents an enhancement of CO2/CH4 (≈10) and CO2/N 2 (≈52) selectivities was observed. The experimental permeabilities of the blend membranes were compared with the calculated permeabilities based on a modified additive logarithmic model.},

abstract = {Bestrophins are a recently discovered family of Cl(-) channels, for which no structural information is available. Some family members are activated by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Bestrophins feature a well conserved Asp-rich tract in their COOH terminus (Asp-rich domain), which is homologous to Ca2+-binding motifs in human thrombospondins and in human big-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channels (BK(Ca)). Consequently, the Asp-rich domain is also a candidate for Ca2+ binding in bestrophins. Based on these considerations, we constructed homology models of human bestrophin-1 (Best1) Asp-rich domain using human thrombospondin-1 X-ray structure as a template. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify Asp and Glu residues binding Ca2+ and to predict the effects of their mutations to alanine. We then proceeded to test selected mutations in the Asp-rich domain of the highly homologous mouse bestrophin-2. The mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells were investigated by electrophysiological experiments using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Based on our molecular modeling results, we predicted that Asp-rich domain has two defined binding sites and that D301A and D304A mutations may impact the binding of the metal ions. The experiments confirmed that these mutations do actually affect the function of the protein causing a large decrease in the Ca2+-activated Cl(-) current, fully consistent with our predictions. In addition, other studied mutations (E306A, D312A) did not decrease Ca2+-activated Cl(-) current in agreement with modeling results.},

It shows that the anisotropy cannot be explained in terms of a variation of the ionization rates with the angle between the electric field and the molecular axis. Instead, the anisotropy is caused by the deflection of the ion fragments in the strong field due to the molecular polarizability. Although the molecules are frozen in space on the time scale of the laser pulse, they gain enough angular momentum to affect the trajectories of the fragments. Classical trajectory calculations support this explanation.},

In contrast to a resent experimental interpretation we find that excitonic cross peaks exist between the dominant exciton states. Opposed to common cases the transition dipole directions between these coupled states are uncorrelated.  The assignment of the distinct peaks observed in the OH stretch lineshape of ice I h is controversial. Recent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic measurements provided new data. The spectra are, however, challenging to interpret and here we provide simulations that help overcome experimental issues as thermal signals and finite pulse duration. We find good agreement with experiment and the difference between H 2 O and D 2 O ices is well accounted for. The overall dynamics is demonstrated to be faster than observed for the corresponding liquid water. We find that excitonic cross peaks exist between the dominant exciton peaks. This leads us to conclude that the cross peaks arise due to the formation of delocalized exciton states, which have essentially no directional correlation between their transition dipoles as opposed to what is commonly seen, for example, in isolated water, where the transition dipoles of the eigenstates are perpendicular to each other. },

abstract = {Ionic liquids with cyano anions have long been used because of their unique combination of low-melting temperatures, reduced viscosities and increased conductivities. Recently we have shown that cyano anions in ionic liquids are particularly interesting for their potential use as electron donors to excited state photo-acceptors (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2015, 119, 14790- 14799). Here we report on bulk structural and quantum mechanical results for a series of ionic liquids based on the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation, paired with the following five cyano anions, SeCN−, SCN−, N(CN)− 2 , C(CN)− 3 , and B(CN)− 4 . By combining molecular dynamics simulations, high-energy wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements and periodic boundary condition DFT calculations we are able to obtain a comprehensive description of liquid landscape as well as the nature of HOMO-LUMO states for these in the condensed phase. Features in the structure functions for these ILs are somewhat different than the commonly observed adjacency, charge-charge and polarity peaks, especially for the bulkiest B(CN)− 4 anion. While the other four cyano-anion ILs present an anionic HOMO, the one for Im+ 2,1/B(CN)− 4 is cationic.},

abstract = {Three different ionic liquids are investigated via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using the force field of Lopes and PAdua (J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 19586). In particular, the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation EMIM+ is studied in the presence of three different anions, namely, chloride Cl-, tetrafluoroborate BF(4)(-), and bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyly)imide TF2N-. In the focus of the present study are the static distributions of anions and cations around a cation as a function of anion size. It is found that the preferred positions of the anions change from being close to the imidazolium hydrogens to being above and below the imidazolium rings. Lifetimes of hydrogen bonds are calculated and found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of pure liquid water and of some small primary alcohols. Three kinds of short-range cation-cation orderings are studied, among which the offset stacking dominates in all of the investigated ionic liquids. The offset stacking becomes weaker from [EMIM][Cl] to [EMIM][BF4] to [EMIM][TF2N]. Further investigation of the dynamical behavior reveals that cations in [EMIM][TF2N] have a slower tumbling motion compared with those in [EMIM][Cl] and [EMIM][BF4] and that pure diffusive behavior can be observed after 1.5 ns for all three systems at temperatures 90 K above the corresponding melting temperatures.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the complex and heterogeneous dynamics of ions in ionic liquids. The dynamics of cations and anions in 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium nitrate (EMIM-NO(3)) are characterized by van Hove functions and the corresponding intermediate scattering functions F(s)(k,t) and elucidated by the trajectories augmented by the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Several time regions are found in the mean squared displacement of the ions. Change in the slope in a plot of the diffusion coefficient against temperature is found at around 410 K in the simulation. Heterogeneous dynamics with the presence of both localized ions and fast ions capable of successive jumps were observed at long time scales in the self-part of the van Hove functions and in the trajectories. Non-Gaussian dynamics are evidenced by the self-part of the van Hove functions and wave number dependence of F(s)(k,t) and characterized as Levy flights. Successive motion of some ions can continue even after several nanoseconds at 370 K, which is longer than the onset time of diffusive motion, t(dif). Structure of the long time dynamics of fast ions is clarified by the phase space plot of the successive motion using the denoised data by SSA. The continual dynamics are shown to have a long term memory, and therefore local structure is not enough to explain the heterogeneity. The motion connecting localized regions at about 370 K is jumplike, but there is no typical one due to local structural changes during jump motion. With the local motion, mutual diffusion between cation and anion occurs. On decreasing temperature, mutual diffusion is suppressed, which results in slowing down of the dynamics. This "mixing effect of cation and anion" is compared with the "mixed alkali effect" found in the ionics in the ionically conducting glasses, where the interception of paths by different alkali metal ions causes the large reduction in the dynamics [J. Habasaki and K. L. Ngai, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 9, 4673 (2007), and references herein]. Although a similar mechanism of the slowing down is observed, strong coupling of the motion of cation and anion prevents complete interception unless deeply supercooled, and this explains the wide temperature region of the existence of the liquid and supercooled liquid states in the ionic liquid.},

abstract = {The electron-hole pair created via photon absorption in organic photoconversion systems must overcome the Coulomb attraction to achieve long-range charge separation. We show that this process is facilitated through the formation of excited, delocalized band states. In our experiments on organic photovoltaic cells, these states were accessed for a short time(<1 ps) via IR optical excitation of electron-hole pairs bound at the heterojunction. Atomistic modelling showed that the IR photons promote bound charge pairs to delocalized band states, similar to those formed just after singlet exciton dissociation, which indicates that such states act as the gateway for charge separation. Our results suggest that charge separation in efficient organic photoconversion systems occurs through hot-state charge delocalization rather than energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are defined as salts composed solely of ions with melting points below 100 °C. These remarkable liquids have unique and fascinating properties and offer new opportunities for science and technology. New combinations of ions provide changing physical properties and thus novel potential applications for this class of liquid materials. To a large extent, the structure and properties of ionic liquids are determined by the intermolecular interaction between anions and cations. In this perspective we show that far infrared and terahertz spectroscopy are suitable methods for studying the cation-anion interaction in these Coulomb fluids. The interpretation of the measured low frequency spectra is supported by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We present results for selected aprotic and protic ionic liquids and their mixtures with molecular solvents. In particular, we focus on the strength and type of intermolecular interaction and how both parameters are influenced by the character of the ions and their combinations. We show that the total interaction between cations and anions is a result of a subtle balance between Coulomb forces, hydrogen bonds and dispersion forces. For protic ionic liquids we could measure distinct vibrational modes in the low frequency spectra indicating clearly the cation-anion interaction characterized by linear and medium to strong hydrogen bonds. Using isotopic substitution we have been able to dissect frequency shifts related to pure interaction strength between cations and anions and to different reduced masses only. In this context we also show how these different types of interaction may influence the physical properties of ionic liquids such as the melting point, viscosity or enthalpy of vaporization. Furthermore we demonstrate that low frequency spectroscopy can also be used for studying ion speciation. Low vibrational features can be assigned to contact ion pairs and solvent separated ion pairs. In conclusion we showed how detailed knowledge of the low frequency spectra can be used to understand the change in interaction strength and structure by variation of temperature, solvent polarity and solvent concentration in ionic liquids and their mixtures with molecular solvents. In principle the used combination of methods is suitable for studying intermolecular interaction in pure molecular liquids and their solutions including additive materials such as nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Network copolymers, prepared by photopolymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA: CH2{double bond, long}CHCOO(CH2CH2O)14OCCH{double bond, long}CH2) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA: CH2{double bond, long}CHCO(OCH2CH2)8OCH3), have been studied for mixed-gas CO2/H2 and CO2/CH4 separations. Gas separation properties in the networks are sensitive to copolymer composition, temperature, and carbon dioxide fugacity in the feed. In conventional approaches, the effect of temperature can be described by the Arrhenius equation, while the influence of copolymer composition and fugacity can only be described empirically; the corresponding models require a large number of adjustable parameters. However, as shown here, the three factors influencing gas transport correlate well with free volume, and a simplified free volume model with only two adjustable parameters can satisfactorily describe the effects of copolymer composition, temperature, and CO2 fugacity on pure- and mixed-gas transport properties. Copolymer composition and temperature can be directly related to the fractional free volume, while CO2 fugacity of the feed can be correlated with free volume via the glass transition temperature of the polymer-gas mixture, which is computed using Chow's model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aqueous ionic solutions are ubiquitous in chemistry and in biology. Experiments show that ions affect water dynamics, but a full understanding of several questions remains needed: why some salts accelerate water dynamics while others slow it down, why the effect of a given salt can be concentration-dependent, whether the effect of ions is rather local or more global. Numerical simulations are particularly suited to disentangle these different effects, but current force fields suffer from limitations and often lead to a poor description of dynamics in several aqueous salt solutions. Here, we develop an improved classical force field for the description of alkali halides that yields dynamics in excellent agreement with experimental measurements for water reorientational and translational dynamics. These simulations are analyzed with an extended jump model, which allows to compare the effects of ions on local hydrogen-bond exchange dynamics and on more global properties like viscosity. Our results unambiguously show that the ion-induced changes in water dynamics are usually mostly due to a local effect on the hydrogen-bond exchange dynamics; in contrast, the change in viscosity leads to a smaller effect, which governs the retardation only for a minority of salts and at high concentrations. We finally show how the respective importance of these two effects can be directly determined from experimental measurements alone, thus providing guidelines for the selection of an electrolyte with specific dynamical properties. ■ INTRODUCTION Liquid water most often contains dissolved salts that play a central role in many chemical and biological processes. These ions alter water structure and dynamics, which can be studied by a variety of experimental and simulation techniques. 1 While understanding the ion-induced change in water dynamical properties is key to explain critical aspects of the involved processes, rationalizing the effects of a given salt is not straightforward because (i) these effects are very sensitive to the nature of the cation and of the anion; 1 (ii) they exhibit a marked concentration-dependence; 2 and (iii) different techniques probe distinct aspects of water dynamics that are not necessarily affected in the same way and that correspond to very different molecular motions. 3 Therefore, despite recent advances, important questions remain not fully solved: why do some salts accelerate dynamics while others retard it? Why is the effect of a given salt concentration-dependent? Is this effect local (i.e., restricted to the first or second hydration shell) or rather due to a more global property of the solution, for example, analogous to that of pressure, as suggested in some prior studies? 4 Numerical simulations appear as a promising tool to disentangle these different aspects. We recently studied the water reorientation dynamics in various ionic hydration shells and solutions 5−7 using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations analyzed in the framework of the extended jump model (EJM). 3,8 Two mechanisms contribute to the reorientation of water OH groups 3,8 on the picosecond (ps) time scale, which is measured experimentally by NMR or ultrafast infrared spectroscopy: the jump exchange of hydrogen bond (HB) acceptors, and the diffusive reorientation of the frame formed by an intact HB axis between HB exchanges, which scales with the solution viscosity. We had shown that reorientation around dilute solutes, including ions 5−7 but also organic compounds with various properties (hydrophobic, 9 hydrophilic, 10 or amphiphilic 9,10), was slowed or accelerated mainly because of changes in the jump HB exchange time. While in the vast majority of cases, HB exchanges remained the main contribution to the water reorientation dynamics, we had suggested that the slowdown observed in all ionic aqueous solutions at higher concentrations contained a nonspecific contribution, which originates from an increasing frame reorientation time (correlated with an increase in viscosity) and which can become dominant for some salts. 7 Similar observations had been made on other, nonionic solutions. 11},

Standardization in methodology has been instrumental in facilitating multicentre trials with the purpose of evaluating the clinical utility of CTCs. We review the current body of evidence supporting the prognostic value of CTC enumeration in breast, prostate and colorectal cancer, using standardized approaches, and studies evaluating the correlation of CTC number with radiological outcome. The exploitation of CTCs in cancer management, however, is now extending beyond prognostication. As technologies emerge to characterize CTCs at the molecular level, biological information can be obtained in real time, with the promise of serving as a 'surrogate tumour biopsy'. Current studies illuminate the potential of CTCs as pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers and potentially their use in revealing drug resistance in real time. Approaches for CTC characterization are summarized and the potential of CTCs in cancer patient management exemplified via the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations from CTCs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The opportunity to learn more about the biology of metastasis through CTC analysis is now being realized with the horizon of CTC-guided development of novel anticancer therapies.},

In this work, the phase behavior of the ternary system consisting of ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (bmimPF6), TX-100, and water was determined at 25.0 degrees C. The water-in-bmimPF6, bicontinuous, and bmimPF6-in-water microregions of the microemulsions were identified by cyclic voltammetry method using potassium ferrocyanide K4Fe(CN)6 as the electroactive probe. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the UV-vis method were used to characterize the microemulsions. It was demonstrated that the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of the bmimPF6-in-water microemulsions is nearly independent of the water content but increases with increasing bmimPF6 content due to the swelling of the micelles by the ionic liquid. The UV-vis further confirmed the existence of water domains in the water-in-bmimPF6 microemulsions, and the salt potassium ferricyanide K3Fe(CN)6 could be dissolved in the water domains.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) with aprotic heterocyclic anions, or "AHAs," can bind CO2 with reaction enthalpies that are suitable for gas separations, and without suffering large viscosity increases. In the present work, we have synthesized ILs bearing an alkyl-phosphonium cation with indazolide, imidazolide, pyrrolide, pyrazolide and triazolide-based anions that span a wide range of predicted reaction enthalpies with CO2. Each AHA-based IL was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their physical properties (viscosity, glass transition, and thermal decomposition temperature) determined. In addition, the influence of substituent groups on the reaction enthalpy was investigated by measuring the CO2 solubility in each IL at pressures between 0 and 1 bar at 22 °C using a volumetric method. The isotherm-derived enthalpies range between -37 and -54 kJ mol-1 of CO2, and these values are in good agreement with computed enthalpies of gas-phase IL-CO2 reaction products from molecular electronic structure calculations. The AHA ILs show no substantial increase in viscosity when fully saturated with CO2 at 1 bar. Phase splitting and compositional analysis of one of the IL/H2O and IL/H2O/CO2 systems conclude that protonation of the 2-cyanopyrrolide anion is improbable, and this result was confirmed by the equimolar CO2 absorption in the presence of water. Taking advantage of the tunable binding energy and absence of viscosity increase after the reaction with CO2, AHA ILs are promising candidates for efficient and environmental-friendly absorbents in post-combustion CO2 capture.},

Valinomycin was chosen because it forms regular 1 : 1 ion complexes through its ester carbonyl ligands of crystallographically known three-dimensional structure in which the cation is sufficiently enfolded by the molecule that the overall size, shape, and charge distribution of the complex is virtually the same regardless of the species of cation bound (i.e. the complexes are ‘isosteric'). The experimentally measured selectivities are sufficiently similar, in a wide variety of solvent environments, that the differences in free energies measured between the different ion–valinomycin complexes in a convenient solvent can be taken as equivalent to the differences in free energies in vacuo. This enables the adequacy of Warshel's MOLARIS force field for computing ion-specific differences in binding to be tested and provides an opportunity for refining the estimates for the appropriate values of partial charge and Lennard-Jones 6–12 parameters for an ester carbonyl group.},

Considering the MeCN- and MeSCN-water cluster calculation results as databases, we first examined the validity of vibrational Stark effect relationship between the CN frequency and the electric field component parallel to the CN bond and found no strong correlation between the two. However, taking into account of additional electric field vector components is a simple way to generalize the vibrational Stark theory for the nitrile chromophore. Also, the electrostatic potential calculation method has been proposed and examined in detail. It turned out that the interactions of water molecules with nitrogen atom's lone pair orbital and with nitrile pi orbitals can be well described by the electrostatic potential calculation method. The present computational results will be of use to quantitatively simulate various linear and nonlinear vibrational spectra of nitrile compounds in solutions.},

We assess the ability of 2D-IR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate data analysis to quantify changes in secondary structure of the multifunctional calcium-binding messenger protein Calmodulin (CaM) as a function of temperature and Ca2+ concentration. Our approach produced quantitative agreement with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in detecting the domain melting transitions of Ca2+-free (apo) CaM (reduction in $\alpha$-helix structure by 13% (CD) and 15% (2D)). 2D-IR also allows accurate differentiation between melting transitions and generic heating effects observed in the more thermally stable Ca2+-bound (holo) CaM. The functionally relevant random-coil-$\alpha$-helix transition associated with Ca2+ uptake that involves just 7–8 out of a total of 148 amino acid residues was clearly detected. Temperature-dependent Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations show that apo-CaM exists in dynamic equilibrium with holo-like conformations, while Ca2+ uptake reduces conformational flexibility.

abstract = {The interaction of charged species in aqueous solution has important implications for chemical, biological, and environmental processes. We have used 2DIR spectroscopy to study the equilibrium dynamics of thiocyanate chemical exchange between free ion (NCS(-)) and contact ion pair configurations (MNCS(+)), where M(2+) = Mg(2+) or Ca(2+). Detailed studies of the influence of anion concentration and anion speciation show that the chemical exchange observed with the 2DIR measurements results from NCS(-) exchanging with other anion species in the first solvation shell surrounding Mg(2+) or Ca(2+). The presence of chemical exchange in the 2DIR spectra provides an indirect, but robust, determinant of contact ion pair formation. We observe preferential contact ion pair formation between soft Lewis base anions and hard Lewis acid cations. This observation cannot be easily reconciled with Pearson's acid-base concept or Collins' Law of Matching Water Affinities. The anions that form contact ion pairs also correspond to the ions with an affinity for water and protein surfaces, so similar physical and chemical properties may control these distinct phenomena.},

We apply the method to bulk water, and our results are based on the recently developed ab initio maps for the vibrational Hamiltonian. Qualitative agreement between theory and experiment is found for the 2DIR spectra without the use of any fitting or scaling parameters in the Hamiltonian. The calculated spectra for bulk water are not so different from those for HOD in D(2)O, which we can understand by considering the spectral diffusion time-correlation functions in both cases. We also calculate the ultrafast anisotropy decay, which is dominated by population transfer, finding very good agreement with experiment. Finally, we determine the vibrational excitation diffusion rate, which is more than two orders of magnitude faster than the diffusion of the water molecules themselves.},

This analysis indicates that the D(10) interaction constant is essentially zero, rather than the large value (about 20 cm(-1)) required by the earlier application of the perturbation theory. It is suggested that the previously neglected D(11) term should be included in the perturbation expression, and it is shown that the physical origin of such a term can be accounted for by transition dipole coupling. This mechanism is shown to give a reasonable explanation of splittings of the C=O stretching vibrations in hydrogenbonded carboxylic acid dimers. Its application to beta polypeptides provides a satisfactory interpretation of splittings in the Amide I modes.},

abstract = {Infrared ps pump-probe experiments are presented for the P, Q, and R rotational branches of the asymmetric CO stretching mode of tungsten hexacarbonyl (1997 cm−1) in the collisionless gas phase. The pump-probe decays are tri-exponentials (140 ps, 1.3 ns, and >100 ns) in contrast to single exponential decays observed in supercritical fluids and liquid solvents. The 1.3 ns decay component is the vibrational energy relaxation (VER) time. The long component occurs following intramolecular VER into a distribution of low-frequency modes. After VER is complete, the R signal is 48%, the Q signal is 29%, and the P signal is −10% (absorption increase) compared to the t=0t=0 signal. These long-lived signals result from an increase in the occupation numbers of low-frequency modes (internal heating) that causes a shift of the vibrational spectrum. The fastest decay is produced by spectral diffusion. The spectrally narrow pump pulse burns a hole in the inhomogeneous ground state spectrum and generates a narrow spectral population in the excited state (excited state peak). The inhomogeneity arises from the distribution of occupation numbers of the low-frequency modes that produces different combination band spectral shifts. Spectral diffusion is caused by the time evolution of the complex low-frequency thermal vibrational wave packet. Two possible models for the spectral diffusion are evaluated, one in which spectral diffusion reduces the pump-probe signal by hole filling and broadening of the excited state peak, and one in which the spectral diffusion only broadens the excited state peak.},

abstract = {Students' understanding about analogy was investigated after a CORE learning cycle general chemistry experiment. CORE (Chemical Observations, Representations, Experimentation) is a new three-phase learning cycle that involves (phase 1) guiding students through chemical observations while they consider a series of open-ended questions, (phase 2) developing representations using analogical thinking, and (phase 3) designing and conducting experiments in response to a scientific question. In the CORE experiment used in this study, Polymers and Cross Linking, an analogy was employed in phase 2 when students reflected on the similarities and limitations between objects used in the analogy (the analog) and the chemistry under observation (the target). Owing to the reliance on analogical reasoning in the CORE approach, we conducted a study at a single point in time at the very beginning of a lab course to investigate students' understanding about analogy, the importance of considering the limitations of an analogy, and perceived benefits. Four online questions were asked approximately one week after lab work. Student responses (n = 501) across the four questions provided a rich data set of over 60 000 words (averaging >120 words/student). Results indicate that 75% of students have a basic or better understanding of the analogy, 61% of students connected the analogy with either chemical observations from lab and/or submicroscopic thinking, while 8% connected the analogy to both. A majority of students (57%) described the importance of appreciating the limitations of an analogical model and numerous students offered details about how analogy influenced their conceptual understanding. The data provide insight into student understanding about analogy and the degree to which students recognize the limitations of an analogy, as well as student perceptions of the benefits of the approach. This study informs those interested in developing curricula around the CORE approach and suggests design criteria for investigating student learning when analogies are used as part of lab work.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the solvation dynamics of the weakly\npolar organic solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) via classical molecular\ndynamics simulation. We find that the relaxation dynamics of all\nof the rotational and translational degrees of freedom of neat THF\noccur on similar time scales and have similar power spectra, making\nit impossible to use spectral density analysis to discern which specific\nmolecular motions are involved in solvation. Instead, we probe the\nmolecular origins of solvation dynamics using a nonequilibrium projection\nformalism that we originally outlined in M. J. Bedard-Hearn et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. A 2003, 107 (24), 4773. Here, we expand this formalism\nand use it to study the nonequilibrium solvation dynamics for a model\nreaction in THF in which a charge is removed from an anionic Lennard-Jones\n(U) solute, leaving behind a smaller neutral atom. The solute parameters\nare chosen to model the photodetachment of an electron from a sodium\nanion, Na- --> Na-0, to compare to the results of ultrafast spectroscopic\nexperiments of this reaction being performed in our lab. We are able\nto explain the hidden breakdown of linear response for this system\nthat we uncovered in our previous work in terms of the dynamical\nproperties of the neat liquid and the structural properties of the\nsolutions. In particular, our nonequilibrium projection analysis\nshows that four distinct solvation mechanisms are operative: (1)\na rapid relaxation (t less than or equal to 700 fs) caused by longitudinal\ntranslational motions that dramatically change the local solvation\nstructure; (2) a slower relaxation (t > 700 fs) caused by diffusive\nlongitudinal translational motions that completes the transformation\nof the long-range solute-solvent packing; (3) an early-time relaxation\n(t < 500 fs) caused by solvent rotational motions that destabilizes\nthe (unoccupied) anion ground state via Coulomb interactions; (4)\na longer time process (t greater than or equal to 500 fs) caused\nby solvent rotational motions that increases the solvation energy\ngap. This last process results from the LJ interaction component\nof the solvent rotational motions, as the nonequilibrium dynamics\nbring smaller THF-oxygen sites closer to the excited solute in place\nof larger THF-methylene sites. Overall, the simulations indicate\nthat nonequilibrium solvation dynamics involves cooperative motions\nof both the solute and solvent and consists of multiple competing\nrelaxation processes that can affect the solvation energy gap in\nopposite directions.},

The OH stretching frequency distinguishes hydrogen bonded (HB) and non-hydrogen-bonded (NHB) configurations by their absorption on the low (red) and high (blue) sides of the line shape. Measured asymmetries in the two dimensional infrared OH line shapes are manifestations of the fundamentally different spectral relaxations of HB and NHB. HB oscillators exhibit coherent oscillations within the hydrogen-bonded free energy well before undergoing activated barrier crossing, resulting in the exchange of hydrogen bonded partners. Conversely, NHB oscillators rapidly return to HB frequencies within 150fs. These results support a picture where NHB configurations are only visited transiently during large fluctuations about a hydrogen bond or during the switching of hydrogen bonding partners. The results are not consistent with the presence of entropically stabilized dangling hydrogen bonds or a conceptual picture of water as a mixture of environments with varying hydrogen bond strength separated by barriers >kT.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread importance of aqueous bicarbonate chemistry, its conjugate acid, carbonic acid, has remained uncharacterized in solution. Here we report the generation of deuterated carbonic acid in deuterium oxide solution by ultrafast protonation of bicarbonate and its persistence for nanoseconds. We follow the reaction dynamics upon photoexcitation of a photoacid by monitoring infrared-active marker modes with femtosecond time resolution. By fitting a kinetic model to the experimental data, we directly obtain the on-contact proton-transfer rate to bicarbonate, previously inaccessible with the use of indirect methods. A Marcus free-energy correlation supports an associated pKa (Ka is the acid dissociation constant) of 3.45 +/- 0.15, which is substantially lower than the value of 6.35 that is commonly assumed on the basis of the overall carbon dioxide-to-bicarbonate equilibrium. This result should spur further exploration of acid-base reactivity in carbon dioxide-rich aqueous environments such as those anticipated under sequestration schemes.},

abstract = {The functions of the members of the S100 family of EF-hand proteins are modulated by calcium and, in a number of cases, by zinc or copper. One such protein is S100A12, which is implicated in inflammation and host-parasite responses. Previously, we reported the structures of human S100A12 in both low (dimeric) and high (hexameric) calcium forms and, in addition, that of a complex with copper and calcium. Here we report the crystal structures of the metal-free apo form of human S100A12 at 1.77 A resolution and of the zinc complex in two crystal forms (P2(1)2(1)2(1) and F222) to 1.88 A and 1.73 A resolution, respectively. These are the first structures of a zinc-only complex of an S100 protein to be determined. The zinc complex structure shows significant differences from those of both calcium-loaded and apo-S100A12 structures, and comparisons suggest an explanation for the zinc-induced 1500-fold increase in calcium affinity. In addition, the new structures provide insight into the role of zinc-calcium interplay in the transition of S100A12 from a dimer through a tetramer to a hexamer. The role of both zinc and calcium in target binding by S100A12 during host-parasite responses is confirmed by experiments with paramyosin from the tropical parasites Onchocerca volvulus and Brugia malayi.},

Because the two spectra from each molecule are correlated before addition to produce a macroscopic signal, the 2D peak shape contains new microscopic information about the dynamics of individual molecular environments. Peak shapes in 2D femtosecond spectroscopy are investigated computationally with the Brownian oscillator model of Yan and Mukamel, which incorporates time-resolved spontaneous solvent fluctuations and forced solvent reorganization after excitation. These computations reveal the origin of the off-diagonal displacement of the diagonal 2D peaks, the negative region above the diagonal, and the peak shape distortions produced by manipulation of the phase-matched response with noncollinear pulses.},

Properties of the pure ionic liquid included thermal properties (triple-point temperature, glass-transition temperature, enthalpy of fusion, heat capacities of condensed states), volumetric properties, speeds of sound, viscosities, electrolytic conductivities, and relative permittivities. Properties for mixtures included gas solubilities, solute activity coefficients at infinite dilution, liquid-liquid equilibrium temperatures, and excess volumes.

abstract = {It is generally accepted that the anomalous diffusion of the aqueous hydroxide ion results from its ability to accept a proton from a neighboring water molecule; yet, many questions exist concerning the mechanism for this process. What is the solvation structure of the hydroxide ion? In what way do water hydrogen bond dynamics influence the transfer of a proton to the ion? We present the results of femtosecond pump-probe and 2D infrared experiments that probe the O-H stretching vibration of a solution of dilute HOD dissolved in NaOD/D2O. Upon the addition of NaOD, measured pump-probe transients and 2D IR spectra show a new feature that decays with a 110-fs time scale. The calculation of 2D IR spectra from an empirical valence bond molecular dynamics simulation of a single NaOH molecule in a bath of H2O indicates that this fast feature is due to an overtone transition of Zundel-like H3O2− states, wherein a proton is significantly shared between a water molecule and the hydroxide ion. Given the frequency of vibration of shared protons, the observations indicate the shared proton state persists for 2–3 vibrational periods before the proton localizes on a hydroxide. Calculations based on the EVB-MD model argue that the collective electric field in the proton transfer direction is the appropriate coordinate to describe the creation and relaxation of these Zundel-like transition states.},

abstract = {The effects of anthropogenic emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and the halocarbons on stratospheric ozone (O 3 ) over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are isolated using a chemical model of the stratosphere. The future evolution of ozone will depend on each of these gases, with N 2 O and CO 2 probably playing the dominant roles as halocarbons return towards pre-industrial levels. There are nonlinear interactions between these gases that preclude unambiguously separating their effect on ozone. For example, the CH 4 increase during the twentieth century reduced the ozone losses owing to halocarbon increases, and the N 2 O chemical destruction of O 3 is buffered by CO 2 thermal effects in the middle stratosphere (by approx. 20% for the IPCC A1B/WMO A1 scenario over the time period 1900–2100). Nonetheless, N 2 O is expected to continue to be the largest anthropogenic emission of an O 3 -destroying compound in the foreseeable future. Reductions in anthropogenic N 2 O emissions provide a larger opportunity for reduction in future O 3 depletion than any of the remaining uncontrolled halocarbon emissions. It is also shown that 1980 levels of O 3 were affected by halocarbons, N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 , and thus may not be a good choice of a benchmark of O 3 recovery.},

abstract = {Ion–molecule complexation dynamics were studied with CH3SCN and Li+ in acetonitrile by vibrationally probing the nitrile stretching vibration of CH3SCN. The nitrile stretching vibration of CH3SCN has a long lifetime (T1 = ∼90 ps) and its frequency is significantly blue-shifted when CH3SCN is bound with Li+ ions to form a CH3SCN⋯Li+ complex in acetonitrile. Such spectral properties enable us to distinguish free CH3SCN and the CH3SCN⋯Li+ complex in solutions and measure their dynamics occurring on hundred picosecond timescales. For the complexation between CH3SCN and Li+ in acetonitrile, the change in enthalpy ($\Delta$H = −7.17 kJ mol−1) and the change in entropy ($\Delta$S = −34.4 J K−1 mol−1) were determined by temperature-dependent FTIR experiments. Polarization-controlled infrared pump–probe (IR PP) spectroscopy was used to measure the population decay and orientational dynamics of free CH3SCN and the CH3SCN⋯Li+ complex. Especially, the orientational relaxation of the CH3SCN⋯Li+ complex was found to be almost 3 times slower than those of free CH3SCN because Li+ ions strongly interact with the neighboring solvents. Most importantly, the complexation dynamics of CH3SCN and Li+ in acetonitrile were successfully measured in real time by 2DIR spectroscopy for the first time and the dissociation and association time constants were directly determined by using the two-species exchange kinetic model. Our experimental results provide a comprehensive overview of the ion–molecule complexation dynamics in solutions occurring under thermal equilibrium conditions.},

We observe the transition of those mixtures from pure IL to aqueous solution by analyzing the changes in important bulk properties (density) and structural and bonding properties (radial distribution functions, water clustering, hydrogen bonding, and cationic stacking) as well as dynamical properties (diffusion coefficients) at 12 different concentration samplings of each mixture, ranging from 0.0 to 99.95 mol % water. Our simulations revealed across all of the different structural, bonding, and dynamical properties major structural changes consistent with a transition from IL-water mixture to aqueous solution in all three ILs at water concentrations around 75 mol %. Among the structural changes observed were rapid increase in the frequency of hydrogen bonds, both water-water and water-anion. Similarly, at these critical concentrations, the water clusters formed begin to span the entire simulation box, rather than existing as isolated networks of molecules. At the same time, there is a sudden decrease in cationic stacking at the transition point, followed by a rapid increase near 90 mol % water. Finally, the diffusion coefficients of individual cations and anions show a rapid transition from rates consistent with diffusion in IL's to rates consistent with diffusion in water beginning at 75 mol % water. The location of this transition is consistent, for [bmim]Cl and [dmim][DMP], with the water concentration limit above which the ILs are unable to dissolve cellulose.},

abstract = {A series of cross-linked polymers, XLPEGDA, was prepared by photopolymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) in the presence of varying amounts of water or monofunctional poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) to vary cross-link density. All of the polymers had essentially the same chemical composition but displayed a systematic variation in cross-link density as estimated from water swelling experiments, models such as the FloryRehner and modified FloryRehner theories, and dynamic mechanical testing. Cross-link density decreased with increasing water or PEGMEA content in the prepolymer solutions. Interestingly, gas solubility, diffusivity, and permeability were essentially independent of cross-link density for the series of materials prepared from PEGDA and water. The polymer density, fractional free volume, glass transition temperature, and polymer d spacing were also constant when water was used to vary cross-link density. On the basis of this result, it appears that cross-link density does not necessarily affect gas diffusion and permeation, the polymer glass transition temperature, or the fractional free volume in network polymers, and ascribing changes in these properties to changes in cross-link density alone, as is seen commonly in the literature, should be done with great care.},

abstract = {The issues of electronic polarizability in molecular dynamics simulations are discussed. We argue that the charges of ionized groups in proteins, and charges of ions in conventional non-polarizable force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS, etc should be scaled by a factor about 0.7. Our model explains why a neglect of electronic solvation energy, which typically amounts to about a half of total solvation energy, in non-polarizable simulations with un-scaled charges can produce a correct result; however, the correct solvation energy of ions does not guarantee the correctness of ion-ion pair interactions in many non-polarizable simulations. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional non-polarizable force field simulations. The model also explains the striking difference between the value of water dipole $\mu$∼ 3D reported in recent ab initio and experimental studies with the value $\mu$(eff)∼ 2.3D typically used in the empirical potentials, such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the effective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value $\mu$(eff) = $\mu$/√$\epsilon$(el), where $\epsilon$(el) = 1.78 is the electronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple theoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the effective parameters, which is crucial when the computational models of liquid water are used for simulations in different environments, such as proteins, or for interaction with solutes.},

abstract = {Ion specific effects on salting-in and salting-out of proteins, protein denaturation, as well as enzymatic activity are typically rationalized in terms of the Hofmeister series. Here, we demonstrate by means of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations that the traditional explanation of the Hofmeister ordering of ions in terms of their bulk hydration properties is inadequate. Using triglycine as a model system, we show that the Hofmeister series for anions changes from a direct to a reversed series upon uncapping the N-terminus. Weakly hydrated anions, such as iodide and thiocyanate, interact with the peptide bond, while strongly hydrated anions like sulfate are repelled from it. In contrast, reversed order in interactions of anions is observed at the positively charged, uncapped N-terminus, and by analogy, this should also be the case at side chains of positively charged amino acids. These results demonstrate that the specific chemical and physical properties of peptides and proteins play a fundamental role in ion specific effects. The present study thus provides a molecular rationalization of Hofmeister ordering for the anions. It also provides a route for tuning these interactions by titration or mutation of basic amino acid residues on the protein surface.},

abstract = {Previously, we reported on using Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in place of traditional solvents for supported liquid membranes to take advantage of their unique properties. This previous work used RTILs with the hexafluorophosphate [PF6]- anion. However, the [PF 6]- anion in the presence of water can break down into HF. In the current work, we studied RTIL-membranes made from the following water stable anions: bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide [Tf2N]-, trifluoromethanesulfone [CF3SO3]-, chloride [Cl]-, and dicyanamide [dca]-. We report CO2 permeabilities of 350 barrers (for [Cl]-) to 1000 barrers (for [Tf2N]-) combined with CO2/N2 ideal selectivities of 15 (for [Cl]-) to 61 (for [dca]-). Note that these permeability/selectivities place RTIL-membranes above the upper-bound in a CO2/N2 Robeson plot of representative polymers. The CO2/CH4 ideal selectivities range from 4 (for [Cl] -) to 20 (for [dca]-), thereby placing the [dca]-membrane above the upper-bound for the CO2/CH4 Robeson plot. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Different conformers of a cation-anion pair based on their molecular interactions are simulated in the gas phase and in a dielectric continuum solvent environment. Although the ordering of conformers in energy varies with theoretical methods, their predictions for three lowest energy conformers in the gas phase are similar. Strong C-H---N interactions between the acidic hydrogen atom of the cation imidazole ring and the nitrogen atom of the anion are predicted for either the lowest or second lowest energy conformer. In a continuum solvent, different theoretical methods yield the same ion-pair conformation for the lowest energy state. In both phases, the density functional method predicts that the anion is in a trans conformation in the lowest energy ion pair state. The theoretical results are compared with experimental observations from Raman scattering and IR absorption spectroscopies and manifestations of the molecular interactions in the vibrational spectra are discussed. The directions of the frequency shifts of the characteristic vibrations relative to the free anion and cation are explained by calculating the difference electron density coupled with electron density topography.},

abstract = {The polarized and depolarized Raman spectra of 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-trifluoro acetate (Bmim TFA) ionic liquid and of the dense phase obtained after introduction of supercritical carbon dioxide (313K) under pressure (from 0.1 MPa up to 9 MPa) in the ionic liquid have been recorded. The spectrum of the pure ionic liquid has been assigned by comparison with the spectra of ionic liquids sharing the same cation and using literature data concerning the vibrational modes of the TFA anion. It was found that the spectra of the ionic liquid is almost unaffected by the CO(2) dilution. The only noticeable perturbation concerns a weak enhancement of the mode assigned here to the symmetric stretch vibration of the COO group of the TFA anion. The band shape analysis of the $\nu$(CC) band in pure Bmim TFA shows that the carboxylate groups probe a variety of environments which are almost not affected by the dilution in carbon dioxide. The analysis of the Fermi dyad of carbon dioxide shows that this molecule is perturbed upon dilution in the ionic liquid. The spectra suggest the presence of carbon dioxide in two different environments. In the first one, carbon dioxide molecules interact with themselves, whereas in the second environment, this molecule interacts with the COO group of the TFA anion. This is supported by B3LYP-DFT calculations aimed at assessing the interaction between an ion pair dimer and a carbon dioxide molecule. It is shown that dissolved CO(2) molecules preferentially interact with the TFA anion through a weak charge transfer interaction taking place between the carbon atom of CO(2) (acting as a Lewis acid) and a oxygen atom of the COO group of TFA (as a Lewis base). The results show that Bmim TFA is able to accommodate a large amount of carbon dioxide without having its short-range local structure significantly perturbed. Most CO(2) is hosted in the voids existing among the ion pairs, while some also weakly interact with the anion. It is finally argued that the evolution of the local organization of the IL upon carbon dioxide dilution presents similarities with the microsegregation phenomena reported for IL upon increasing the alkyl chains lengths.},

If the temperature is above the critical temperature of CO2 then the methanol-rich phase can become completely miscible with the CO2-rich phase, and this new phase is completely ionic liquid-free. Since CO2 is nonpolar, it is not equipped to solvate ions. As the CO2 dissolves in the methanol/[C4mim][PF6] mixture, the solvent power of the CO2-expanded liquid is significantly reduced, inducing the formation of the second liquid phase that is rich in ionic liquid. This presents a new way to recover products from ionic liquid mixtures and purify organic phases that have been contaminated with ionic liquid. Moreover, these results have important implications for reactions done in CO2/ionic liquid biphasic mixtures.},

For this purpose, we simulate the translational diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions, the rotational correlation times of the C(2)--H bond in the cation C(2)mim(+), and the viscosities of the whole system. We find that the SE and SED relations are not valid for the pure ionic liquid, nor for IL/chloroform mixtures down to the miscibility gap (at 50 wt % IL). The deviations from both relations could be related to dynamical heterogeneities described by the non-Gaussian parameter alpha(t). If alpha(t) is close to zero, at a concentration of 1 wt % IL in chloroform, both relations become valid. Then, the effective radii and volumes calculated from the SE and SED equations can be related to the structures found in the MD simulations, such as aggregates of ion pairs. Overall, similarities are observed between the dynamical properties of supercooled water and those of ionic liquids.},

However, aspects of the methodology as traditionally applied to solutions may not be uniformly applicable in these more viscous and chemically complex systems. In this paper we present data which shows that the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) method in particular suffers from intrinsic internal gradients and can produce apparent diffusion coefficients which vary by as much as 20% for different 1H nuclei within a given molecule--an obvious anomaly. In contrast, we show that the Pulsed Gradient Stimulated Echo method does not suffer from this problem to the same extent and produces self-consistent data to a high degree of accuracy (better than 1%). This level of significance has allowed the detection, in this work, of subtle mixing effects in [C(3)mpyr][NTf(2)] and [C(4)mpyr][NTf(2)] mixtures.},

abstract = {This paper reviews and ranks major proposed energy-related solutions to global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy security while considering other impacts of the proposed solutions, such as on water supply, land use, wildlife, resource availability, thermal pollution, water chemical pollution, nuclear proliferation, and undernutrition. Nine electric power sources and two liquid fuel options are considered. The electricity sources include solar-photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, tidal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The liquid fuel options include corn-ethanol (E85) and cellulosic-E85. To place the electric and liquid fuel sources on an equal footing, we examine their comparative abilities to address the problems mentioned by powering new-technology vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), and flex-fuel vehicles run on E85. Twelve combinations of energy source-vehicle type are considered. Upon ranking and weighting each combination with respect to each of 11 impact categories, four clear divisions of ranking, or tiers, emerge. Tier 1 (highest-ranked) includes wind-BEVs and wind-HFCVs. Tier 2 includes CSP-BEVs, geothermal-BEVs, PV-BEVs, tidal-BEVs, and wave-BEVs. Tier 3 includes hydro-BEVs, nuclear-BEVs, and CCS-BEVs. Tier 4 includes corn-and cellulosic-E85. Wind-BEVs ranked first in seven out of 11 categories, including the two most important, mortality and climate damage reduction. Although HFCVs are much less efficient than BEVs, wind-HFCVs are still very clean and were ranked second among all combinations. Tier 2 options provide significant benefits and are recommended. Tier 3 options are less desirable. However, hydroelectricity, which was ranked ahead of coal-CCS and nuclear with respect to climate and health, is an excellent load balancer, thus recommended. The Tier 4 combinations (cellulosic-and corn-E85) were ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste. Cellulosic-E85 ranked lower than corn-E85 overall, primarily due to its potentially larger land footprint based on new data and its higher upstream air pollution emissions than corn-E85. Whereas cellulosic-E85 may cause the greatest average human mortality, nuclear-BEVs cause the greatest upper-limit mortality risk due to the expansion of plutonium separation and uranium enrichment in nuclear This paper reviews and ranks major proposed energy-related solutions to global warming, air pollution mortality, and energy security while considering impacts of the solutions on water supply, land use, wildlife, resource availability, reliability, thermal pollution, water pollution, nuclear proliferation, and undernutrition. To place electricity and liquid fuel options on an equal footing, twelve combinations of energy sources and vehicle type were considered. The overall rankings of the combinations (from highest to lowest) were (1) wind-powered battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), (2) wind-powered hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, (3) concentrated-solar-powered-BEVs, (4) geothermal-powered-BEVs, (5) tidal-powered-BEVs, (6) solar-photovoltaic-powered-BEVs, (7) wave-powered-BEVs, (8) hydroelectric-powered-BEVs, (9-tie) nuclear-powered-BEVs, (9-tie) coal-with-carbon-capture-powered-BEVs, (11) corn-E85 vehicles, and (12) cellulosic-E85 vehicles. The relative ranking of each electricity option for powering vehicles also applies to the electricity source providing general electricity. Because sufficient clean natural resources (e.g., wind, sunlight, hot water, ocean energy, etc.) exist to power the world for the foreseeable future, the results suggest that the diversion to less-efficient (nuclear, coal with carbon capture) or non-efficient (corn-and cellulosic E85) options represents an opportunity cost that will delay solutions to global warming and air pollution mortality. The sound implementation of the recommended options requires identifying good locations of energy resources, updating the transmission system, and mass-producing the clean energy and vehicle technologies, thus cooperation at multiple levels of government and industry. energy facilities worldwide. Wind-BEVs and CSP-BEVs cause the least mortality. The footprint area of wind-BEVs is 2–6 orders of magnitude less than that of any other option. Because of their low footprint and pollution, wind-BEVs cause the least wildlife loss. The largest consumer of water is corn-E85. The smallest are wind-, tidal-, and wave-BEVs. The US could theoretically replace all 2007 onroad vehicles with BEVs powered by 73 000–144 000 5 MW wind turbines, less than the 300 000 airplanes the US produced during World War II, reducing US CO 2 by 32.5–32.7% and nearly eliminating 15 000/yr vehicle-related air pollution deaths in 2020. In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security. Coal-CCS and nuclear offer less benefit thus represent an opportunity cost loss, and the biofuel options provide no certain benefit and the greatest negative impacts.},

In contrast, 2D HD-VSFG spectrum of the CTAB/H2O interface at 0.0 ps clearly shows two diagonal peaks and their cross peaks in the bleaching region, corresponding to the double peaks observed at 3230 cm(-1) and 3420 cm(-1) in the steady-state HD-VSFG spectrum. Horizontal slices of the 2D spectrum show that the relative intensity of the two peaks of the bleaching at the CTAB/H2O interface gradually change with the change of the pump frequency. We simulate the pump-frequency dependence of the bleaching feature using a model that takes account of the Fermi resonance and inhomogeneity of the OH stretch vibration, and the simulated spectra reproduce the essential features of the 2D HD-VSFG spectra of the CTAB/H2O interface. The present study demonstrates that heterodyne detection of the time-resolved VSFG is critically important for studying the ultrafast dynamics of water interfaces and for unveiling the underlying mechanism.},

abstract = {Data are now rapidly accumulating to show that metallochemical reactions might be the common denominator underlying Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion diseases, cataracts, mitochondrial disorders and Parkinson's disease. In these disorders, an abnormal reaction between a protein and a redox-active metal ion (copper or iron) promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species or radicalization. It is especially intriguing how the powerful catalytic redox activity of antioxidant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase can convert into a pro-oxidant activity, a theme echoed in the recent proposal that A?? and PrP, the proteins respectively involved in Alzheimer's disease and prion diseases, possess similar redox activities.},

These protons are readily detected by their reaction with pH indicators. The kinetics are followed by transient light absorption techniques with a time resolution of 100 ns. The observed proton cycle, protonation and relaxation of the indicator, is a sum of simultaneous first- and second-order reactions between the various reactants. This dynamic is a complex function of all rate constants and reactant concentrations. In the present study, we employed a numerical solution of nonlinear differential rate equations to simulate the dynamics of the observed proton cycle. This analysis permits a direct determination of the diffusion-controlled rate constants of all participating reactions with an accuracy better than 20%. {\textcopyright} 1983 American Chemical Society.},

Detailed analysis of the spectra shows conclusively, as has long been inferred from ultrasonic absorption studies, the simultaneous presence of double solvent separated (2SIP), solvent-shared (SIP), and contact (CIP) ion pairs. The constants derived for the stepwise formation of each ion pair type and for the overall association are in excellent agreement with literature estimates based on other kinds of measurements. In addition, evidence has been obtained for the existence of a triple ion, Mg2SO42+(aq), or possibly a more aggregated species, at high electrolyte concentrations (c > 1 M). Support for the presence of CIPs, SIPs, and the triple ion is provided by Raman spectroscopy. The implications of the present findings for quantitative models of the thermodynamic behavior of higher-valent electrolytes are briefly discussed},

Besides its ultrafast time-resolution, a so far largely underappreciated potential of 2D-IR spectroscopy lies in its sensitivity gain.

abstract = {In this work, tuning the solubility parameter of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) with appended functional groups was explored using a combination of experiment and theory. By predictably altering the solubility parameters of several RTIL solvents, their gas solubility and separation performance were tailored. This concept was demonstrated by synthesizing and characterizing imidazolium-based RTILs that incorporate nitrile and alkyne functional substituents. The ideal solubility and selectivity values of CO2, N2, and CH4 at near ambient temperature and pressure were measured for these RTILs. These functionalized RTIL solvents exhibited lower CO2, N2, and CH4 solubility values but improved CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 solubility selectivity when compared to analogous nonfunctionalized, n-alkyl-substituted RTILs. A group contribution method was used to predict the solubility parameters of the functionalized RTILs, and these values were used with regular solution theory to predict the solubility and selectivity of the three gases. These predicted gas solubility values were found to be in good agreement with those measured experimentally. Furthermore, the predictions from the group contribution method indicated that inclusion of the nitrile and alkyne functional groups increased the solubility parameter relative to the analogous, n-alkyl-substituted RTILs. These initial results show that the group contribution method offers a valuable guide for systematically designing functionalized RTILs with specific gas solubility and selectivity performance.},

Marked changes in the bands associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of the carboxylate groups induced by metal-ion binding could be discerned for PAL/ODS self-assembled bilayers (SABs) in contact with Cd2+ solutions of pH = 6 even at concentrations in the sub-$\mu$M range. Subsequent exposure of Cd2+/PAL/ODS SABs to solutions of pH < 4 devoid of Cd2+ led to the removal of Cd2+ from the bilayer leaving behind a better ordered structure, as judged by the shift of the C−H stretching modes toward lower wavenumbers. Spectral evidence for strong metal−terminal sulfonate group interactions was also obtained for HDSA/ODS SABs immersed in solutions containing Cd2+, Fe3+, and Fe2+, },

These new ionic liquids show exceptional CO2 permeability values in liquid membrane gas separations with results that equal or exceed the Robeson upper bound. Moreover, these ionic liquids offer ideal CO2/N2 selectivities competitive with the best results reported to date, exhibiting values that range from 28 to 45. The nitrile containing ionic liquid displayed the highest ideal CO2/N2 selectivity with a value of 45 which primarily results from a reduction in the nitrogen permeability. In addition to permeability results, CO2 solubilities were also measured for the this new class of ionic liquids with values similar to the popular 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. The CO2 solubility results were compared to predicted values obtained using both a modified regular solution theory and the quantum chemical Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) method. Agreement between predicted and measured solubility values is also discussed.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

While for the first a 6-fold octahedral complex has been observed, the presence of an additional coordinating water ligand has been observed in the latter case. Because of rapidly exchanging water molecules, this 7-fold coordination complex was found to form pentagonal bipyramidal as well as capped trigonal prismatic configurations along the simulation interchanging on the picosecond time scale. Also in the case of [MgEDTA](2-) a trigonal prismatic configuration has been observed for a very short time period of approximately 1 ps. This work reports for the first time the presence of trigonal prismatic structures observed in the coordination sphere of [MgEDTA](2-) and [CaEDTA](2-) complexes in aqueous solution. In addition to the detailed characterization of structure and dynamics of the systems, the prediction of the associated infrared spectra indicates that the ion-water vibrational mode found at approximately 250 cm(-1) provides a distinctive measure to experimentally detect the presence of the coordinating water molecule via low-frequency IR setups.},

abstract = {Clean energy production has become one of the most prominent global issues of the early 21st century, prompting social, economic, and scientific debates regarding energy usage, energy sources, and sustainable energy strategies. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide (CO(2)), figures prominently in the discussions on the future of global energy policy. Billions of tons of annual CO(2) emissions are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion to generate electricity. Producing clean energy from abundant sources such as coal will require a massive infrastructure and highly efficient capture technologies to curb CO(2) emissions. Current technologies for CO(2) removal from other gases, such as those used in natural gas sweetening, are also capable of capturing CO(2) from power plant emissions. Aqueous amine processes are found in the vast majority of natural gas sweetening operations in the United States. However, conventional aqueous amine processes are highly energy intensive; their implementation for postcombustion CO(2) capture from power plant emissions would drastically cut plant output and efficiency. Membranes, another technology used in natural gas sweetening, have been proposed as an alternative mechanism for CO(2) capture from flue gas. Although membranes offer a potentially less energy-intensive approach, their development and industrial implementation lags far behind that of amine processes. Thus, to minimize the impact of postcombustion CO(2) capture on the economics of energy production, advances are needed in both of these areas. In this Account, we review our recent research devoted to absorptive processes and membranes. Specifically, we have explored the use of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) in absorptive and membrane technologies for CO(2) capture. RTILs present a highly versatile and tunable platform for the development of new processes and materials aimed at the capture of CO(2) from power plant flue gas and in natural gas sweetening. The desirable properties of RTIL solvents, such as negligible vapor pressures, thermal stability, and a large liquid range, make them interesting candidates as new materials in well-known CO(2) capture processes. Here, we focus on the use of RTILs (1) as absorbents, including in combination with amines, and (2) in the design of polymer membranes. RTIL amine solvents have many potential advantages over aqueous amines, and the versatile chemistry of imidazolium-based RTILs also allows for the generation of new types of CO(2)-selective polymer membranes. RTIL and RTIL-based composites can compete with, or improve upon, current technologies. Moreover, owing to our experience in this area, we are developing new imidazolium-based polymer architectures and thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals as highly tailorable materials based on and capable of interacting with RTILs.},

abstract = {We demonstrate how multimode 2D IR spectroscopy of the protein amide I' and II' vibrations can be used to distinguish protein secondary structure. Polarization-dependent amide I'-II' 2D IR experiments on poly-l-lysine in the beta-sheet, alpha-helix, and random coil conformations show that a combination of amide I' and II' diagonal and cross peaks can effectively distinguish between secondary structural content, where amide I' infrared spectroscopy alone cannot. The enhanced sensitivity arises from frequency and amplitude correlations between amide II' and amide I' spectra that reflect the symmetry of secondary structures. 2D IR surfaces are used to parametrize an excitonic model for the amide I'-II' manifold suitable to predict protein amide I'-II' spectra. This model reveals that the dominant vibrational interaction contributing to this sensitivity is a combination of negative amide II'-II' through-bond coupling and amide I'-II' coupling within the peptide unit. The empirically determined amide II'-II' couplings do not significantly vary with secondary structure: -8.5 cm(-1) for the beta sheet, -8.7 cm(-1) for the alpha helix, and -5 cm(-1) for the coil.},

abstract = {The diffusion of helium, neon, argon, oxygen and hydrogen through high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate has been studied in the temperature range 4-44°. The polymer samples were thin disc membranes cut from mercury cast films and showed no orientation discernible by optical means. The very low permeabilities encountered were measured using a micro-Pirani gage to minimize the volume of the outgoing side of the diffusion system. Diffusion coefficients were determined using the time-lag method and permeabilities from steady state measurements. Solubilities were obtained from the ratios of these coefficients. Fick's and Henry's laws were accurately obeyed for all the gases over the temperature and pressure range investigated. Logarithmic plots of diffusion, permeability and solubility coefficients against reciprocal temperature show two transition temperatures. The upper one, 26°, is the same for all the gases and corresponds with the usually quoted second-order transition of polyvinyl acetate. The lower one decreases from 18-15° as the molecular size of the diffusing gas increases. The heats of solution of the gases usually reverse sign from negative to positive on entering the transition region from below. The activation energy for diffusion is small over the transition region, and is larger above the region than below it. The results are interpreted in terms of a molecular-kinetic picture of the change in bulk structure of the polymer in passing through the transition region. {\textcopyright} 1954, American Chemical Society.

Using ultrafast (<50 fs) infrared multidimensional stimulated vibrational echo correlation spectroscopy with full phase information, the experiments examine frequency correlation between initially excited OD stretches and their “photoproducts” created by hydrogen bond breaking following vibrational relaxation. The hydrogen bond breaking following vibrational relaxation gives rise to a new species, singly hydrogen bonded MeODs, the photoproduct. The photoproducts give rise to a well-defined spectrally distinct off-diagonal peak in the correlation spectrum. Detailed modeling of this peak is used to measure its spectral diffusion (increased spectral broadening as time increases). A rephasing vibrational echo signal and spectral diffusion can only occur if photoproduct hydroxyl stretch frequencies are highly correlated with the frequencies of the initially excited hydroxyl stretches prior to hydrogen bond breaking. The observation of spectral diffusion (fine frequency correlation) demonstrates that broken oligomers have “memory” of initial unbroken oligomers. Possible explanations for the frequency correlation are discussed.},

abstract = {Premelting at the surface of ice crystals is caused by factors such as temperature, radius of curvature, and solute composition. When polycrystalline ice samples are warmed from well below the equilibrium melting point, surface melting may begin at temperatures as low as −15°C. However, it has been reported (Bronshteyn and Steponkus, 1993. Biophys. J. 65:1853–1865) that when polycrystalline ice was warmed in a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) pan, melting began at about −50°C, this extreme behavior being attributed to short-range forces. We show that there is no driving force for such premelting, and that for pure water samples in DSC pans curvature effects will cause premelting typically at just a few degrees below the equilibrium melting point. We also show that the rate of warming affects the slope of the DSC baseline and that this might be incorrectly interpreted as an endotherm. The work has consequences for DSC operators who use water as a standard in systems where subfreezing runs are important.},

In this review, environmentally relevant issues of ILs, including their environmental application, environmental behavior and toxicity are addressed. In addition, also presented are the influence of ILs on the environmental fate and toxicity of other coexisting contaminants, important routes for designing nontoxic ILs and the techniques that might be adopted for the removal of ILs.},

This approach employs a newly developed nanofluidic cell for transient soft X-ray spectroscopy in the liquid phase. Distinct changes in the near-edge spectral region (XANES) are observed, and are indicative of a transient temperature rise of 10 K following transient laser excitation and rapid thermalization of vibrational energy. The rapid heating occurs at constant volume and the associated increase in internal pressure, estimated to be 8 MPa, is manifested by distinct spectral changes that differ from those induced by temperature alone. We conclude that the near-edge spectral shape of the oxygen K-edge is a sensitive probe of internal pressure, opening new possibilities for testing the validity of water models and providing new insight into the nature of hydrogen bonding in water.},

There are existing models developed for determining frequencies of and couplings between the secondary amide units. However, these are not applicable to proline because this amino acid has a tertiary amide unit. Therefore, a new parametrization is required for infrared-spectroscopic studies of proteins that contain proline, such as collagen, the most abundant protein in humans and animals. Here, we construct the electrostatic and dihedral maps accounting for solvent and conformation effects on frequency and coupling for the proline unit. We examine the quality and the applicability of these maps by carrying out spectral simulations of a number of peptides with proline in D(2)O and compare with experimental observations.},

By varying both the time delay between the 400 nm phototrigger and the 2DIR probe as well as the waiting time in the 2DIR pulse sequence, we directly determine the orientational relaxation of the vibrationally hot photoproduct. The orientational relaxation slows as the photoproduct cools, providing a measure of the transient temperature decay time of 70 ± 16 ps. We compare the experimental results with molecular dynamics simulations and find near quantitative agreement for equilibrium orientational diffusion time constants but only qualitative agreement for nonequilibrium thermal relaxation. The simulation also shows that the experiment probes an unusual regime of thermal excitation, where the solute is heated while the solvent remains essentially at room temperature.},

At high pH, where the electric field resulting from deprotonation of silanol groups polarizes several layers of water molecules, fast vibrational dynamics similar to the dynamics of bulk water is observed. At the neutral surface, where the structural ordering of interfacial water and the thickness of interfacial water are smaller than those at the charged surface, the vibrational lifetime of the O-H stretch becomes more than two times longer (T(1) approximately 570 fs). The longer vibrational lifetime is a result of reduced intermolecular coupling resulting from incomplete solvation of the interfacial water species.},

abstract = {Theory and experimental data are presented which illustrate a new method for performing two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy using ultrafast pulsed infrared lasers, called vibrational echo spectroscopy (VES). The VES technique can generate a vibrational spectrum with background suppression using the nonlinear vibrational echo pulse sequence. The vibrational echo pulse sequence is used with the delay between the excitation pulses fixed while the excitation wavelength is varied. A detailed theory of VES is presented which calculates the full third order nonlinear polarization including rephasing and nonrephasing diagrams. Finite width laser pulses are used and the calculations are performed for a model spectrum with two or more peaks. Two mechanisms that can result in background and peak suppression are illustrated. The mechanisms are based on differences in homogeneous dephasing times (T-2) or transition dipole matrix element magnitudes. Although the VES line shape differs from the absorption line shape, it is possible to recover the absorption line shape from the VES. The method is demonstrated experimentally on the vibrational mode of CO (center at 1945 cm(-1)) bound to the active site of the protein myoglobin (Mb-CO). The protein and solvent produce a large absorption background while the VES spectrum of Mb-CO is background free. Calculations are able to reproduce the experimental Mb-CO VES line shape.

The results demonstrate that B3LYP, combined with the highly compact double-$\zeta$ basis set 6-31+G* and “scaled quantum mechanics” techniques, offers excellent quantitative performance in the calculations of relative IR intensities and frequencies ($\nu$ ≤ 2200 cm–1) for the bands of vibrations of medium-size isolated molecules, whereas it produces unsatisfactory results for the solutions of the same species. Neither larger basis sets nor implicit treatment of the media effects improve the agreement of the simulated spectra with the condensed-phase experiment.

The solvent effects on this reaction have been examined using both multiparameter linear solvation energy relationships and theoretical calculations. These latter have been performed using a supermolecular approach, i.e., the IL is represented by an explicit ionic pair, IP. Two possible different reaction pathways have been obtained changing the position of the IL-IP with respect to the reagents. It is hypothesized that inside the IL the Menschutkin reaction of benzyl chloride with N-methylimidazole can follow different reaction pathways by considering the influence of dynamic heterogeneity in ionic media on the time scale of the lifetime of a transition state.},

abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy vector offers great potential for mobile energy generation through fuel cell technology, however this depends on safe, mobile and high density storage of hydrogen. The destabilised multi-component complex hydride system LiBH4 : MgH2 was investigated in order to characterise the destabilisation reactions which enable reduction of operating temperatures for this high capacity system (ca. 9.8 wt.%). In-situ neutron diffraction showed that regardless of stoichiometry similar reaction paths were followed forming LiH and MgB2 when decomposed under H2 and Mg-Li alloys (Mg0.816Li0.184 and Mg0.70Li0.30) when under dynamic vacuum. Hydrogen isotherms of the 0.3LiBH4 : MgH2 showed a dual plateau behaviour with the lower plateau due to the destabilised LiBH4 reaction. Thermodynamic data calculated from the isotherm results showed a significant reduction in the T(1bar) for LiBH4 to 322 C (cf. 459 C for LiBH4(l)). Cycling behaviour of 0.3LiBH4 : MgH2 system decomposed under both reaction environments showed very fast kinetics on deuteriding at 400C and 100 bar D2, reaching 90 % conversion within 20 minutes. In contrast 2LiBH4 : MgH2 samples had kinetics an order of magnitude slower and after 4 hours conversions <50 %. These results demonstrate the strong influence of stoichiometry in the cycling kinetics compared to decomposition conditions. Investigation of catalysts found dispersion of metal hydrides through long ball-milling times, or dispersion through reaction with metal halide additions provided the greatest degree of kinetic advantage, with pre-milled NbH providing the best kinetic improvement without reducing capacity due to Li-halide formation. Finally, additions of LiAlH4 to the system formed an Al dispersion through the sample during decomposition, which acted both as a catalyst and destabilising agent on the MgH2 component, forming Mg-Al-Li alloys. Decomposition under H2 also showed a destabilisation effect for the LiBH4 component.},

abstract = {Capturing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from flue gases with porous materials has been considered as a viable alternative technology to replace traditional liquid amine adsorbents. A large number of microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as CO 2 -capturing materials. However, it is challenging to target materials with both extremely high CO 2 capture capacity and gas selectivity (so-called trade-off) along with moderate regeneration energy. Herein, we developed a novel porous material, [Cu(dpt) 2 (SiF 6 )] n (termed as UTSA-120; dpt = 3,6-di(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine), which is isoreticular to the net of SIFSIX-2-Cu-i. This material exhibits simultaneously high CO 2 capture capacity (3.56 mmol g −1 at 0.15 bar and 296 K) and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (∼600), both of which are superior to those of SIFSIX-2-Cu-i and most other MOFs reported. Neutron powder diffraction experiments reveal that the exceptional CO 2 capture capacity at the low-pressure region and the moderate heat of CO 2 adsorption can be attributed to the suitable pore size and dual functionalities (SiF6 2− and tetrazine), which not only interact with CO 2 molecules but also enable the dense packing of CO 2 molecules within the framework. Simulated and actual breakthrough experiments demonstrate that UTSA-120a can efficiently capture CO 2 gas from the CO 2 /N 2 (15/85, v/v) and CO 2 /CH 4 (50/50) gas mixtures under ambient conditions.},

While much of current literature highlights slower nanosecond solvation mechanisms in bulk ionic liquids, we observe only a femtosecond response, supporting morphology dependent and interface specific electron solvation mechanisms. The injected excess electron is found to reside in an electron affinity level residing near the metal surface. Population of this state decays back to the metal with a time constant of 400 ± 150 fs. Electron solvation is measured as a dynamic decrease in the energy with a time constant of 350 ± 150 fs. We observe two distinct temperature regimes, with a critical temperature near 250 K. The low temperature regime is characterized by a higher work function of 4.41 eV, while the high temperature regime is characterized by a lower work function of 4.19 eV. The total reorganizational energy of solvation changes above and below the critical temperature. In the high temperature regime, the electron affinity level solvates by 540 meV at 350 K, and below the critical temperature, solvation decreases to 200 meV at 130 K. This study will provide valuable insight to interface specific solvation of room temperature ionic liquids.},

It is appreciated that the vibrations governing liquid water's molecular dynamics are delocalized, with nuclear motion evolving coherently over the span of several molecules. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we have found that the nuclear motions of heavy water, D2O, are qualitatively different than those of H2O. The nonlinear spectrum of liquid D2O reveals distinct O-D stretching resonances, in contrast to H2O. Furthermore, our data indicates that condensed-phase O-D vibrations have a different character than those in the gas phase, which we understand in terms of weakly delocalized symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations. This difference in molecular dynamics reflects the shift in the balance between intra- and intermolecular couplings upon deuteration, an effect which can be understood in terms of the anharmonicity of the nuclear potential energy surface.},

abstract = {X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) are used to study water in aqueous solutions of NaCl, MgCl(2), and AlCl(3) with the particular aim to provide information about the structure of the hydration shells of the cations. The XRS spectra show that Na(+) weakens the hydrogen bonds of water molecules in its vicinity, similar to the effect of increased temperature and pressure. Mg(2+) and Al(3+), on the other hand, cause the formation of short and strong hydrogen bonds between the surrounding water molecules. The SAXS data show that Mg(2+) and Al(3+) form tightly bound hydration shells that give a large density contrast in the scattering data. From the form factors extracted from the SAXS data, we found that Mg(2+) and Al(3+) have, respectively, an equivalent of one and one and a half stable hydration shells that appear as a density contrast. In addition, we estimated that the density of water in the hydration shells of Mg(2+) and Al(3+) is, respectively, ∼61% and ∼71% higher than in bulk water.},

abstract = {Steady-state and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy of the azide (N(3)-) anion has been used to characterize aqueous mixtures both with the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF(4)]) and with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the DMSO-water mixtures, two anion vibrational bands are observed for low water mole fractions (0 > X(w) > 0.25), which indicates a heterogeneous ion solvation environment. The band at 2000 cm(-1) observed for neat DMSO does not shift but decreases in amplitude as the amount of water is increased. Another band appears at slightly higher frequency at low X(w) (=0.05). As the amount of water is increased, this band shifts to higher frequency and becomes stronger and is attributed to azide with an increasing degree of hydration. At intermediate and high X(w), a single band is observed that shifts almost linearly with water mole fraction toward the bulk water value. The heterogeneity is evident from the infrared pump-probe studies in which the decay times depend on probe frequency at low mole fraction. For the azide spectra in IL-water mixtures, a single azide band is observed for each mole fraction mixture. The azide band shifts almost linearly with mole fraction, indicating nearly ideal mixing behavior. As with the DMSO-water mixtures, the time-resolved IR decay times are probe-frequency-dependent at low mole fraction, again indicating heterogeneous solvation. In both the DMSO and IL mixtures with water, the relaxation times are slower than would be expected from ideal mixing, suggesting that vibrational relaxation of azide is more sensitive than its vibrational frequency to the solvent structure. The results are discussed in terms of preferential solvation and the degree to which the azide shift and vibrational relaxation depend on the degree of water association in the mixtures.},

The molecular packing parameter is defined as vo/aelo, where vo is the surfactant tail volume, lo is the tail length, and ae is the equilibrium area per molecule at the aggregate surface. A particular value of the molecular packing parameter can be translated via simple geometrical relations into specific shape and size of the equilibrium aggregate. This is the predictive application of the concept of molecular packing parameter, as discussed in the literature. In calculating the packing parameter, the dominant notion in the literature is that the surfactant headgroup determines the surface area per molecule of equilibrium aggregates ae. It follows that, given a headgroup, the molecular packing parameter vo/aelo is fixed, because the volume-to-length ratio (vo/lo) of the tail is a constant independent of the tail length for common surfacta...},

abstract = {The unusual solubility of carbon dioxide in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (Bmim Ac) has been studied by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. It is shown that the solubility results from the existence of two distinct solvation regimes. In the first one (CO(2) mole fraction ≤ 0.35), the usual Fermi dyad is not observed, a fact never reported before for binary mixtures with organic liquids or ionic liquids (IL). Strong experimental evidence complemented by effective DFT modeling shows that this regime is dominated by a chemical reaction leading to the carboxylation of the imidazolium ring accompanied by acetic acid formation. The reactive scheme proposed involves two concerted mechanisms, which are a proton exchange process between the imidazolium cation and the acetate anion and the carboxylation process itself initiated from the formation of "transient" CO(2)-1-butyl-3-methylimidazole 2-ylidene carbene species. In that sense, CO(2) triggers the carboxylation reaction. Moreover, this dynamic picture circumvents consideration of a long-lived carbene formation in dense phase. The second regime is characterized by the detection of the CO(2) Fermi dyad showing that the carboxylation reaction has been strongly moderated. This finding has been interpreted as due to the interaction of the acetic acid molecules with the COO group of acetate anions involved in monodentate forms with the cation. The observation of the Fermi doublet allows us to infer that CO(2) essentially preserves its linear geometry and that the nature and strength of the interactions with its environment should be comparable to those existing in organic liquids and other IL as well. These results have been supported by DFT calculations showing that the CO(2) molecule interacts with energetically equivalent coexisting structures and that its geometry departs only slightly from the linearity. Finally, we find that the CO(2) solvation in Bmim Ac and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (Bmim TFA) cannot be straightforwardly compared neither in the first regime due to the existence of a chemical reaction nor in the second regime because CO(2) interacts with a variety of environments not only consisting of ions pairs like in Bmim TFA but also with carboxylate and acetic acid molecule.},

abstract = {Since the middle of 20(th) century infrared (IR) spectroscopy coupled to microscopy (IR microspectroscopy) has been recognized as a non destructive, label free, highly sensitive and specific analytical method with many potential useful applications in different fields of biomedical research and in particular cancer research and diagnosis. Although many technological improvements have been made to facilitate biomedical applications of this powerful analytical technique, it has not yet properly come into the scientific background of many potential end users. Therefore, to achieve those fundamental objectives an interdisciplinary approach is needed with basic scientists, spectroscopists, biologists and clinicians who must effectively communicate and understand each other's requirements and challenges. In this review we aim at illustrating some principles of Fourier transform (FT) Infrared (IR) vibrational spectroscopy and microscopy (microFT-IR) as a useful method to interrogate molecules in specimen by mid-IR radiation. Penetrating into basics of molecular vibrations might help us to understand whether, when and how complementary information obtained by microFT-IR could become useful in our research and/or diagnostic activities. MicroFT-IR techniques allowing to acquire information about the molecular composition and structure of a sample within a micrometric scale in a matter of seconds will be illustrated as well as some limitations will be discussed. How biochemical, structural, and dynamical information about the systems can be obtained by bench top microFT-IR instrumentation will be also presented together with some methods to treat and interpret IR spectral data and applicative examples. The mid-IR absorbance spectrum is one of the most information-rich and concise way to represent the whole "{\ldots} omics" of a cell and, as such, fits all the characteristics for the development of a clinically useful biomarker.},

This peptidic fragment molecule is a useful model for investigating water/peptide hydrogen bond competition. The simulations predict considerable NMA self-association even at low concentrations with a concentration-dependent increase in the ratio of branched to linear clusters. Water-mediated NMA contacts are a feature of this regime, manifested by an unexpected increase in the number of short NMA oxygen contacts arising from water bridge motifs. In contrast, bulk water structure is significantly disrupted by the addition of even small quantities of NMA. With increases in NMA concentration water molecules become progressively more isolated, forming dimers and trimers hydrogen-bonded to NMA. The mixture in this concentration regime may therefore offer a minimal model system for certain structural properties of interior water buried in protein cavities and hydrogen-bonded to mainchain peptide groups.},

Cl- ions form instead hydrogen-bonded bridges with water molecules and are readily accommodated into the H-bond network of water.

The steady-state Im$\chi$((2)) spectra show a drastic intensity decrease with excess salts, indicating that the thickness of the probed water layer is substantially reduced. Fluoride salts do not noticeably affect spectral features in the OH stretch region whereas the chloride and bromide salts induce significant blue shifts of the OH stretch frequency. Femtosecond time-resolved $\Delta$Im$\chi$((2)) spectra obtained with fluoride salts exhibit a very broad bleach even at 0 fs as observed without excess salts, while chloride and bromide salts give rise to a narrow spectral hole burning. These results indicate that the excess chloride and bromide ions strongly interact with interfacial water in the vicinity of the charged interface and it suppresses intramolecular coupling (i.e., Fermi resonance) that causes spectral broadening.},

abstract = {A combination of vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to study the changes in morphology and conformational order in monolayers prepared from three natural sphingomyelin (SM) mixtures as a function of surface pressure and cholesterol concentration. The most homogeneous SM gave monolayers with well-ordered acyl chains and few gauche defects with relatively small effects of either increasing surface pressure or cholesterol addition. Heterogeneous SM mixtures with a mixture of acyl chain lengths or with significant fractions of unsaturated acyl chains had much larger contributions from gauche defects at low surface pressure and gave increasingly well-ordered monolayers as the surface pressure increased. They also showed substantial increases in lipid chain order after cholesterol addition. Overall, these results are consistent with the strong hydrogen bonding capacity of SM leading to well-ordered monolayers over a range of surface pressures. The changes in acyl chain order for natural SMs as a function of cholesterol are relevant to formation of sphingolipid-cholesterol enriched domains in cell membranes.},

The results offer additional insight into salol dynamics and into time-dependent transient grating measurements of this class.

abstract = {This review describes how kinetic experiments using techniques with dramatically improved time resolution have contributed to understanding mechanisms in protein folding. Optical triggering with nanosecond laser pulses has made it possible to study the fastest-folding proteins as well as fundamental processes in folding for the first time. These include formation of $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-sheets, and contacts between residues distant in sequence, as well as overall collapse of the polypeptide chain. Improvements in the time resolution of mixing experiments and the use of dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance methods have also allowed kinetic studies of proteins that fold too fast (≳ 103 s−1) to be observed by conventional methods. Simple statistical mechanical models have been extremely useful in interpreting the experimental results. One of the surprises is that models originally developed for explaining the fast kinetics of secondary structure formation in isolated peptides are also successful in calculating folding rates of single domain proteins from their native three-dimensional structure.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca -sensing protein that is highly conserved and ubiquitous in eukaryotes. In humans it is a locus of life-threatening cardiomyopathies. The primary function of CaM is to transduce Ca concentration into cellular signals by binding to a wide range of target proteins in a Ca -dependent manner. We do not fully understand how CaM performs its role as a high-fidelity signal transducer for more than 300 target proteins, but diversity among its four Ca -binding sites, called EF-hands, may contribute to CaM's functional versatility. We therefore looked at the conservation of CaM sequences over deep evolutionary time, focusing primarily on the four EF-hand motifs. Expanding on previous work, we found that CaM evolves slowly but that its evolutionary rate is substantially faster in fungi. We also found that the four EF-hands have distinguishing biophysical and structural properties that span eukaryotes. These results suggest that all eukaryotes require CaM to decode Ca signals using four specialized EF-hands, each with specific, conserved traits. In addition, we provide an extensive map of sites associated with target proteins and with human disease and correlate these with evolutionary sequence diversity. Our comprehensive evolutionary analysis provides a basis for understanding the sequence space associated with CaM function and should help guide future work on the relationship between structure, function, and disease.},

Comparisons are made between the ytterbium-based technology and titanium sapphire laser systems for time-resolved IR spectroscopy measurements. The 100 kHz probing system provides new capability in time-resolved multiple-probe experiments, as more information is obtained from samples in a single experiment through multiple-probing. This method uses the high repetition-rate probe pulses to repeatedly measure spectra at 10 $\mu$s intervals following excitation allowing extended timescales to be measured routinely along with ultrafast data. Results are presented showing the measurement of molecular dynamics over >10 orders of magnitude in timescale, out to 20 ms, with an experimental time response of <200 fs. The power of multiple-probing is explored through principal component analysis of repeating probe measurements as a novel method for removing noise and measurement artifacts.},

abstract = {FTIR spectroscopy has been applied to study the coordination structures of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions bound in Akazara scallop troponin C (TnC), which contains only a single Ca2+ binding site. The region of the COO- antisymmetric stretch provides information about the coordination modes of COO- groups to the metal ions: bidentate, unidentate, or pseudo-bridging. Two bands were observed at 1584 and 1567 cm-1 in the apo state, whereas additional bands were observed at 1543 and 1601 cm-1 in the Ca2+-bound and Mg2+-bound states, respectively. The intensity of the band at 1567 cm-1 in the Mg2+-bound state was identical to that in the apo state. Therefore, the side-chain COO- group of Glu142 at the 12th position in the Ca2+-binding site coordinates to Ca2+ in the bidentate mode but does not interact with Mg2+ directly. A slight upshift of COO- antisymmetric stretch due to Asp side-chains was also observed upon Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding. This indicates that the COO- groups of Asp131 and Asp133 interact with both Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the pseudo-bridging mode. Therefore, the present study directly demonstrated that the coordination structure of Mg2+ was different from that of Ca2+ in the Ca2+-binding site. In contrast to vertebrate TnC, most of the secondary structures remained unchanged among apo, Mg2+-bound and Ca2+-bound states of Akazara scallop TnC, as spectral changes upon either Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding were very small in the infrared amide-I' region as well as in the CD spectra. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the spectral changes upon Ca2+ binding were larger than that upon Mg2+ binding. Moreover, gel-filtration experiments indicated that the molecular sizes of TnC had the order apo TnC > Mg2+-bound TnC > Ca2+-bound TnC. These results suggest that the tertiary structures are different in the Ca2+- and Mg2+-bound states. The present study may provide direct evidence that the side-chain COO- groups in the Ca2+-binding site are directly involved in the functional on/off mechanism of the activation of Akazara scallop TnC.},

abstract = {The plasmon resonance of noble metal nanoparticles (NP) manifests itself in a variety of extraordinary optical properties. Resonant excitation of the conduction electrons by incident radiation generates a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that is responsible for a variety of surface enhanced optical phenomena. This unique optical property coupled with well-established surface chemistry allows us to utilize both Ag and Au NP as optical contrasting agents to probe and monitor the surface receptors of cells. We have employed two plasmon-assisted optical techniques (namely, surface enhanced Raman scattering, and resonant Rayleigh scattering) to monitor the adrenergic receptors in mammalian cardiomyocyte cells that have been labeled with functionalized Ag NPs. In this study, a unique Raman reporter molecule, 4-(mercaptomethyl)benzonitrile, was developed to provide an easily identifiable vibration, the C≡N stretch, in a spectral window free from Raman bands of cell constituents and other biomolecules used in receptor crosslinking and surface passivation. Successfully labeled cells were then monitored with both optical techniques. Both techniques are related through the plasmonic properties of the noble metal NP and combined with high resolution imaging techniques; we outline the importance that different NP architectures play in the different imaging techniques. Furthermore, we will discuss the instrumentation and plasmonic implications in the design of NP best suited for such multimodal imaging approaches.},

abstract = {Blending CO2-selective ionic liquid with block copolymers have been shown to improve the gas separation performance. In this work, defect-free Pebax{\textregistered}1657/[emim][BF4] gel membranes were fabricated in the form of thin film composite hollow-fiber membranes to meet the mechanical stability and high packing density requirement for industrial application. Environmentally benign solvent comprising ethanol/water mixture (70/30 w/w) was selected to allow up to 80 wt% IL loading with 300% improvement in CO2 permeability and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities of 36 and 15, respectively. Characterizations of membrane morphological change responding to the IL loading indicated that the preferential interaction between IL and PEO segments was by hydrogen bonding that resulted in decrease in polymer crystallinity, but this interaction inhibited potential interaction with CO2, which lowered the gas permeability below the estimated value. Examinations on the effects of various operating conditions on the TFC gel membranes showed excellent mechanical durability and chemical stability of the membranes and good CO2 separation performance with mixed-gas feed containing traces of water vapor and NOx, suggesting the potential application for CO2 capture with real gas feed. The stability of the high IL-loaded gel membranes with up to 8 bar feed pressure also opens up possibility for other industrial gas applications.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of Lepidium sativum L. germination to three imidazolium ionic liquids was investigated in solutions and soils artificially contaminated with mixtures of those compounds. In case of aquatic solutions, the toxic character of analyzed compounds is connected with their hydrophobicity. The seedling growth is increasing with the decrease in ionic liquid hydrophobicity. The novelty of those studies is the application of high-performance liquid chromatography, which was used for the determination of ionic liquid quantity absorbed by cress. There was almost linear relationship between decrease in root germination and amount of ionic liquid uptaken by cress. Furthermore, the systematic studies on the influence of total organic carbon content in soil on the toxicity of ionic liquids to cress were performed for the first time. Hazardous effects appeared to be closely connected with organic matter: with the decrease of total organic carbon quantity, the inhibition of plant growth was more significant. Visual effects of ionic liquid toxic activity to garden cress are similar as in the case of nutrient deficit in plants.},

As an example, in ionic liquids we often find charge alternation, and at the distance where one finds a density enhancement of charges of the same type one also finds a depletion of charges of opposite sign. Another such situation arises with polar-apolar densities. At distances where there is enhancement of same-type (polar-polar or apolar-apolar) densities there is also a depletion of opposite-type (polar-apolar) density. This gives rise to prepeaks and what we call same spatial periodicity anti-prepeaks.},

abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

abstract = {Tumor cell survival relies upon adaptation to the acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment. To investigate potential acidosis survival mechanisms, we examined the effect of low pH (6.7) on human breast carcinoma cells. Acute low pH exposure reduced proliferation rate, induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest, and increased cytoplasmic vacuolization. Gene expression analysis revealed elevated levels of ATG5 and BNIP3 in acid-conditioned cells, suggesting cells exposed to low pH may utilize autophagy as a survival mechanism. In support of this hypothesis, we found that acute low pH stimulated autophagy as defined by an increase in LC3-positive punctate vesicles, double-membrane vacuoles, and decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ribosomal protein S6. Notably, cells exposed to low pH for approximately 3 months restored their proliferative capacity while maintaining the cytoplasmic vacuolated phenotype. Although autophagy is typically transient, elevated autophagy markers were maintained chronically in low pH conditioned cells as visualized by increased protein expression of LC3-II and double-membrane vacuoles. Furthermore, these cells exhibited elevated sensitivity to PI3K-class III inhibition by 3-methyladenine. In mouse tumors, LC3 expression was reduced by systemic treatment with sodium bicarbonate, which raises intratumoral pH. Taken together, these results argue that acidic conditions in the tumor microenvironment promote autophagy, and that chronic autophagy occurs as a survival adaptation in this setting. },

Phys. Chem. A 2002, 106, 11993]. It is found that the relation between the OH stretch frequency and the length of the hydrogen bond in which the OH is involved is characterized by considerable dispersion. This dispersion, which is in part related to the varying OHO angle of the hydrogen bond, precludes a one-to-one correspondence between the OH frequency and the hydrogen bond length. Further, it is found that the time scale currently interpreted in terms of a stochastic modulation by the surrounding solvent of a highly frictionally damped hydrogen bond system is largely governed by hydrogen bond-breaking and -making dynamics, while the motion of an intact hydrogen-bonded complex is underdamped in character. A detailed analysis of these issues is provided for calculated spectral dynamics after creation of a hole in the ground vibrational state, in terms of a three time analysis (in addition to the H-bond period). Further, the validity of describing the OH frequency fluctuations as a Gaussian random process is examined, as is the character of the associated autocorrelation function of the OH frequency shift.},

Although its physiologic role is uncertain, alpha-synuclein is a synaptic protein that may contribute to plasticity. We produced synuclein with incorporated photoprobes to identify and purify novel synuclein-interacting proteins both to begin to clarify the physiology of synuclein and to identify factors that may regulate synuclein conformation. We detected several cross-links and purified and identified one as calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to both wild type and PD-associated mutant alpha-synucleins in a calcium-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that CaM and alpha-synuclein interact in intact cells in a calcium-dependent manner and that activated CaM accelerates the formation of synuclein fibrils in vitro. We hypothesize that the known calcium control of synuclein function is mediated through CaM interaction and that CaM potentially alters synuclein conformation.},

A value of 16 cm-1 was found for the anharmonicity of the amide I vibration. Vibrational relaxation of the amide I modes of all investigated peptides occurs in ca. 1.2 ps. An even faster value of 450 fs is obtained for NMA, a model for the peptide unit. The vibrational relaxation is dominated by intramolecular energy redistribution (IVR) and reflects an intrinsic property of the peptide group in any environment.

abstract = {Consideration of a large no. of recent data of high precision (±0.02%) for several alkali halides in water showed that the exptl. conductance data could be reproduced within exptl. error by a semi-empirical equation of the form $\Lambda$ = $\Lambda$0 - Sc1/2 + Ec log c + Ac + Bc3/2, (1), where c is the concn., and S and E are given by theory (CA 53: 17639g).  Conductance data for KCl, CsI, NaCl, and CsBr were analyzed by a least-sqs. procedure to obtain the corresponding values of $\Lambda$0, A, and B.  Then, the quantity Y = ($\Lambda$(obs.) - $\Lambda$0 + Sc1/2 - Ec log c)/c was plotted against the sq. root of the concn.  The resulting plots are linear as required by equation (1).  The equation for KCl is $\Lambda$ = 149.936 - 94.88c1/2 + 2548c ln c + 221.0c - 229c3/2.  A computation program is described based on the use of the Fuoss-Onsager linearized conductance equation for unassocd. salts modified to include all terms of order c3/2 and account for ionic assocn.  Conductance data for the following systems were analyzed by the procedure: NaCl in H2O and dioxane-H2O mixts., KCl in H2O and dioxane-H2O mixts., and CsI in H2O and dioxane-H2O mixts.  Ion assocn. becomes steadily less significant as the dielec. const. increases.  For a given dielec. const., ion assocn. becomes more important with increase of concn.  In every case studied, a single contact distance (a) (the center-to-center distance at contact of the rigid charged spheres which represent the ions) serves to predict the conductance of the salt over the entire range of dielec. consts. from that of H2O down to ∼12.  The assocn. consts. in H2O are 0.93 for CsI, 0.80 for KCl, and 0.92 for NaCl.  The dependence of the assocn. const. on the dielec. const. is shown.  The values of a are all considerably larger than the sum of the lattice radii of the ions and clearly must include the diams. of several H2O mols.  This observation suggests that conductance measures the assocn. const. for solvent-sepd. ion pairs.  20 references. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {We investigate the sulfhydryl band of cysteines as a new chromophore for two-dimensional IR (2D-IR) studies of the structure and dynamics of proteins. Cysteines can be put at almost any position in a protein by standard methods of site-directed mutagenesis and, hence, have the potential to be an extremely versatile local probe. Although being a very weak absorber in aqueous environment, the sulfhydryl group gets strongly polarized when situated in an alpha-helix inside the hydrophobic core of a protein because of a strong hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group. The extinction coefficient (epsilon=150 M(-1) cm(-1)) then is sufficiently high to perform detailed 2D-IR studies even at low millimolar concentrations. Using porcine (carbonmonoxy)hemoglobin as an example, which contains two such cysteines in its wild-type form, we demonstrate that spectral diffusion deduced from the 2D-IR line shapes reports on the overall-breathing of the corresponding alpha-helix. The vibrational lifetime of the sulfhydryl group (T1 approximately 6 ps) is considerably longer than that of the much more commonly used amide I mode (approximately 1.0 ps), thereby significantly extending the time window in which spectral diffusion processes can be observed. The experiments are accompanied by molecular dynamics simulations revealing a good overall agreement.},

The spectra were obtained by the use of optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr Effect Spectroscopy at 295 K. The OKE spectra of the mixtures are compared with the calculated mole-fraction weighted sum of the normalized OKE spectra of the neat liquids. The OKE spectra are nearly additive for [C 5mim]Br/[C 5mim][NTf 2] mixtures, but nonadditive for [C 5mim][PF 6]/[C 5mim][TFA] mixtures. In the case of the equimolar [C 5mim][PF 6]/[C 5mim][TFA] mixture, the nonadditivity is such that the experimental OKE spectrum is narrower than the calculated OKE spectrum. The additivity or nonadditivity of OKE spectra for IL mixtures can be explained by assuming ionic liquids are nanostructurally organized into nonpolar regions and ionic networks. The ionic networks in mixtures will be characterized by "random co-networks" for anions that are nearly the same in size (PF 6 (-) and TFA (-)) and by "block co-networks" for anions that differ greatly in size (Br (-) and NTf 2 (-)).},

The two polymers were cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide) and cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide)/siloxane copolymer. Differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry and visual observations were performed to evaluate the ion gels' miscibility, thermal stability and homogeneity. Ionic liquids with the least basic anion (bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and aromatic cations containing acidic proton (e.g. imidazolium and pyridinium) gave the most stable and miscible ion gels. Phase stability was shown to be a function of both ionic liquid content and temperature, with phase separation observed at elevated temperatures. Gas perme-ability testing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen and ionic conductivity measurements confirmed that these ionic liquids increased the gas permeability and ionic conductivity of the polymers.},

[Re(bpy-tBu)(CO)3]- reacts approximately ten times faster with CO2 than does [Re(bpy)(CO)3]-. These reactions occur via a direct two-electron oxidative addition of CO2 to the metal center and result in the formation of an intermediate CO2 reduction product, Re(bpy-R)(CO)3(CO2H). This is the first in situ identification of this key intermediate. Evidence for this Re-CO2H species includes isotopic labeling studies, stopped-flow experiments of the kinetics of its formation in the presence of proton sources, comparison with genuine Re(bpy)(CO)3(CO2H), and DFT calculations.},

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Broadly, there is disagreement among the proposed mechanisms about whether ions occupy adjacent sites in the channel during the transport process. Here, using a mixed quantum-classical approach to calculate theoretical infrared spectra, we propose a set of infrared spectroscopy experiments that can discriminate between mechanisms with and without adjacent ions. These experiments differ from previous ones in that they independently probe specific ion binding sites within the selectivity filter. When ions occupy adjacent sites in the selectivity filter, the predicted spectra are significantly redshifted relative to when ions do not occupy adjacent sites. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental peak frequencies will therefore discriminate the mechanisms.},

This work develops a microscopically based model of heating during multiphoton absorption in liquids induced by high-intensity, short-pulse laser radiation. The dependence on laser pulse parameters and liquid properties is discussed, and pure water exposed to 266 nm laser radiation is investigated both theoretically and experimentally.

abstract = {Poly(vinyl acetate), PVAc, remains the most CO2-soluble non-fluorous polymer identified to date. Small sugar acetates are known to be extraordinarily CO2-philic, but cellulose triacetate, a crystalline high molecule weight polymer is CO2insoluble. Therefore, an amorphous high molecular weight polymer with pendant sugar acetates was synthesized. This polymer, poly(1-O-(vinyloxy) ethyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-$\beta$-d-glucopyranoside, P(AcGIcVE), was indeed CO2-soluble, however cloud point pressures of P(AcGIcVE) at 5 wt% polymer and 298 K were greater than that required for the dissolution of PVAc. Finally, the solubility of amorphous poly(lactic acid), PLA, was determined over a wide range of molecular weight. The corresponding cloud point pressures were much greater than either PVAc or P(AcGIcVE). Ab initio calculations for the CO2/PVAc dimer and CO2/PLA dimer mixtures were conducted in an attempt to elucidate the dramatic differences in the cloud point values of PVAc and PLA. Our calculations indicate that there is little difference in the average interaction energies for the CO2/PLA and the CO2/IPA systems. The only indication that PVAc would be expected to be more CO2-soluble that PLA was that the vinyl acetate dimer has binding modes that will readily accept multiple CO2molecules, whereas the binding modes for the lactic acid dimer can apparently only accommodate a single CO2molecule at a time. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report the simulated vibrational spectra of a mechanosensitive membrane channel in different gating states. Our results show that while linear absorption is insensitive to structural differences, linear dichroism and sum-frequency generation spectroscopies are sensitive to the orientation of the transmembrane helices, which is changing during the opening process. Linear dichroism cannot distinguish an intermediate structure from the closed structure, but sum-frequency generation can. In addition, we find that two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy can be used to distinguish all three investigated gating states of the mechanosensitive membrane channel. SECTION: Biophysical Chemistry and Biomolecules M echanosensitive (MS) channels, which respond to the physical forces applied on a cell membrane, belong to a specialized class of membrane proteins. 1 Once the inner pressure of the cell grows, these channels are sensitive to the change in surface tension in the cell membrane, and start to open a pore. Thus, this mechanism rapidly reduces the inner pressure and ultimately prevents the cell from lysis. During the opening process, MS channels undergo large conformational changes, where a pore existing in the open state is formed by tilting and sliding of the transmembrane helices. 2 Following the solution of its crystal structure, 3 the Mycobacterium tuberculosis MS channel of large conductance (Tb-MscL) has become well-known in the family of MS channels. There are five identical protein chains forming a pentamer structure in Tb-MscL, with each subunit containing two bundles of transmembrane helices known as TM1 and TM2 (Figure 1). The TM1 helix lies around the channel pore forming a constriction near the pore entrance in the cytoplasmic domain. The TM2 helix connects to TM1 through a loop lying on the water/membrane interface of the extracellular domain, and it surrounds the TM1 bundle outwardly. It has been proposed that chemically modified versions of MS channels may be used for targeted drug delivery. 4 For such applications, a better understanding of the gating mechanism in these channels is needed. This has already been investigated both theoretically 5−7 and experimentally. 8−11 However, it is currently not possible to connect experimental observations with microscopic structural changes during the gating process. To achieve this, experiments that are fast enough to be applied during the opening process are needed. Currently applied patch clamp techniques are not fast enough to catch the dynamics during an opening event. 11 Vibrational spectroscopies are good candidates for this, as they can be applied with subnanosecond shutter speed. Vibrational spectra are, however, congested and challenging to interpret. They cannot be directly inverted to give a detailed atomistic picture. The analysis therefore has to rely on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with spectral simulations. Here we will investigate whether vibra-tional spectroscopies can indeed be expected to distinguish between different structures expected during the gating process.},

abstract = {We combine direct surface force measurements with thermodynamic arguments to demonstrate that pure ionic liquids are expected to behave as dilute weak electrolyte solutions, with typical effective dissociated ion concentrations of less than 0.1% at room temperature. We performed equilibrium force-distance measurements across the common ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C4mim][NTf2]) using a surface forces apparatus with in situ electrochemical control and quantitatively modeled these measurements using the van der Waals and electrostatic double-layer forces of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory with an additive repulsive steric (entropic) ion-surface binding force. Our results indicate that ionic liquids screen charged surfaces through the formation of both bound (Stern) and diffuse electric double layers, where the diffuse double layer is comprised of effectively dissociated ionic liquid ions. Additionally, we used the energetics of thermally dissociating ions in a dielectric medium to quantitatively predict the equilibrium for the effective dissociation reaction of [C4mim][NTf2] ions, in excellent agreement with the measured Debye length. Our results clearly demonstrate that, outside of the bound double layer, most of the ions in [C4mim][NTf2] are not effectively dissociated and thus do not contribute to electrostatic screening. We also provide a general, molecular-scale framework for designing ionic liquids with significantly increased dissociated charge densities via judiciously balancing ion pair interactions with bulk dielectric properties. Our results clear up several inconsistencies that have hampered scientific progress in this important area and guide the rational design of unique, high-free-ion density ionic liquids and ionic liquid blends.},

abstract = {Ion gels formed with ABA triblock polymers and ionic liquids (IL) have recently attracted significant attention. Because of their high ionic conductivity, high capacitance, and good mechanical integrity, ion gels prepared from triblock polymers of polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-polystyrene (SMS) and polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene (SOS) and an IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMI][TFSI]) have been successfully applied as the dielectric layer in thin film transistors. However, water absorption can negatively affect the stability of the dielectric layer and lead to electrical breakdown. Consequently, the preferred polymer of these two is SMS. However, the high glass transition temperature (Tg) of PMMA limits the usable SMS polymer concentration in order to ensure comparable ionic conductivity to that of SOS ion gel; this constraint limits the modulus of the gel to about 103 Pa. In this work, we developed a new ABA triblock ion gel system using poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) as a low Tg and hydrophobic midblock. The low Tg of the midblock ensures the ionic conductivity of the resulting ion gels is comparable to that of SOS ion gels at polymer concentrations up to 50 wt %, which is a significant improvement relative to the currently used SMS ion gels. Additionally, by decreasing the size of the midblock at constant polymer concentration, the modulus and ionic conductivity of the ion gels increase synergistically. This interesting and counterintuitive effect reflects the concurrent increase in the number density and chain stretching of midblocks, accompanied by a net reduction in midblock concentration within the conducting phase. We demonstrate that electrolyte gated transistors (EGTs) made with SEAS ion gels have improved stability under ambient humid conditions in comparison to those made with SOS ion gels.

To understand the strength, and hence OH-stretch frequency, of a hydrogen bond, it is crucial to consider the number of additional acceptor hydrogen bonds made by both the donor and acceptor molecules. This necessity for focusing on the hydrogen-bond environment of both donor and acceptor molecules follows from quantum chemical considerations and is related to the three-body interactions in water. Armed with this understanding we can make a detailed interpretation of the OH-stretch IR absorption spectrum of the cage conformer for HOD(D2O)5 and the imaginary part of the ssp OH-stretch sum-frequency spectrum of the surface of liquid D2O with dilute HOD.},

In this theoretical approach it is shown that this view is unfounded, and evidence is provided that, similarly to the benzene-CO(2) system, dispersion interactions are present between the solute and the cation.

The nanosphere matrix is composed of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (DOS) and a triblock copolymer Pluronic({\textregistered}) F-127, which also functions as a surfactant to stabilize the nanoparticle. The particles can be prepared easily in large quantity without resorting to further complicated purification. Dynamic light scattering shows that these particles have a monodisperse size distribution with an average diameter of ∼40 nm, suggesting that the nanoparticles are among the smallest ionophore-based ion-selective nanosensors reported to date. A newly reported oxazinoindoline (Ox) as well as a Nile blue derivative (chromoionophore I) was used as a chromoionophore. Na(+)- and H(+)-selective nanospheres were characterized by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. Owing to the very small size of the nanospheres, the suspension containing the particles is transparent. In the additional presence of the pH indicator HPTS, spectroscopic interrogation of pH and Na(+) in the same sample was demonstrated. As an example, the nanospheres were used to measure the Na(+) level in commercial mineral waters, and the results showed good agreement with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).},

abstract = {A method for modeling infrared solvent shifts using the electrostatic field generated by the solvent is presented. The method is applied to the amide I vibration of N-methyl acetamide. Using ab initio calculations the fundamental frequency, anharmonicity, and the transition dipoles between the three lowest vibrational states are parametrized in terms of the electrostatic field. The generated map, which takes into account the electric field and its gradients at four molecular positions, is tested in a number of common solvents. Agreement of solvent shift and linewidths with experimental Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) data is found to within seven and four wave numbers, respectively, for polar solvents. This shows that in these solvents electrostatic contributions dominate solvation effects and the map is transferable between these types of solvents. The effect of motional narrowing arising from the fast solvent fluctuations is found to be substantial for the FTIR spectra. Also the two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectra, simulated using the constructed map, reproduce experimental results very well. The effect of anharmonicity fluctuations on the 2DIR spectra was found to be negligible.},

abstract = {The time-resolved orientational anisotropies of the OD hydroxyl stretch of dilute HOD in H2OH2O confined on a nanometer length scale in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles are studied using ultrafast infrared polarization and spectrally resolved pump-probe spectroscopy, and the results are compared to the same experiments on bulk water. The orientational anisotropy data for three water nanopool sizes (4.0, 2.4, and 1.7nm1.7nm) can be fitted well with biexponential decays. The biexponential decays are analyzed using a wobbling-in-a-cone model that involves fast orientational diffusion within a cone followed by slower, full orientational relaxation. The data provide the cone angles, the diffusion constants for motion within the cones, and the final diffusion constants as a function of the nanopool size. The two processes can be interpreted as a local angular fluctuation of the OD and a global hydrogen bond network rearrangement process. The trend in the relative amplitudes of the long and short exponential decays suggest an increasing rigidity as the nanopool size decreases. The trend in the long decay constants indicates a longer hydrogen bond network rearrangement time with decreasing reverse micelle size. The anisotropy measurements for the reverse micelles studied extrapolate to ∼0.33∼0.33 rather than the ideal value of 0.4, suggesting the presence of an initial inertial component in the anisotropy decay that is too fast to resolve. The very fast decay component is consistent with initial inertial orientational motion that is seen in published molecular-dynamics simulations of water in AOT reverse micelles. The angle over which the inertial orientational motion occurs is determined. The results are in semiquantitative agreement with the molecular-dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {The effect of ion binding in the selectivity filter of the potassium channel KcsA is investigated by combining amide I Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with structure-based spectral modeling. Experimental difference IR spectra between K+-bound KcsA and Na+-bound KcsA are in good qualitative agreement with spectra modeled from structural ensembles generated from molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular origins of the vibrational modes contributing to differences in these spectra are determined not only from structural differences in the selectivity filter but also from the pore helices surrounding this region. Furthermore, the coordination of K+ or Na+ to carbonyls in the selectivity filter effectively decouples the vibrations of those carbonyls from the rest of the protein, creating local probes of the electrostatic environment. The results suggest that it is necessary to include the influence of the surrounding helices in discussing selectivity and transport in KcsA and, on a more general level, that IR spectroscopy offers a nonperturbative route to studying the structure and dynamics of ion channels.},

Comparisons are made with previously published results of other investigators, and recommendations are made regarding the relative usefulness of these materials as reflectance standards in the mid-IR. Sulfur has strong intrinsic bands at wavelengths >7 µm that must be taken into account for its use as a reflectance standard. Some sulfur samples have hydrocarbon contaminants and in powder form may have adsorbed water, both of which produce bands in the 34-µm region. Potassium bromide has several weak intrinsic bands and is very sensitive to adsorbed water contamination; otherwise it is a good IR reference material. Magnesium oxide and Halon have major band structure and low reflectivity at wavelengths >2.6 µm and thus are unsuitable as reference materials in the mid-IR. Vapor-deposited gold on fine sandpaper (600 grit) is very bright, spectrally flat, and fairly diffuse, so it is the superior material (of those examined) for reflectance reference material throughout the IR. Fine gold powder, on the other hand, is much less bright than evaporated gold, and its reflectivity at wavelengths greater than its particle size is highly sensitive to particle packing density.},

abstract = {The solvation dynamics and local orientational friction for a series of four ionic liquids have been probed using coumarin 153 (C153) as a function of temperature. These ionic liquids are comprised of nonaromatic organic cations paired with a common anion, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NTf(2)-). The specific liquids are as follows: N-methyl-tri-N-butylammonium NTf(2)- (N(1444)+/NTf(2)-), N-hexyl-tri-N-butylammonium NTf(2)- (N(6444)+/NTf(2)-), N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium NTf(2)- (Pyrr(14)+/NTf(2)-), and N-methyl-N-ethoxyethylpyrrolidinium NTf(2)- (Pyrr(1(2O2))+/NTf(2)-). The observed solvation dynamics and fluorescence depolarization dynamics occur over a broad range of time scales that can only be adequately fit by functions including three or more exponential components. Stretched exponential distributions cannot adequately fit our data. The solvation and reorientational dynamics of the C153 probe are studied over a range of temperatures from 278.2 to 353.2 K. For both the solvation dynamics and the probe reorientational dynamics, the observed temperature dependence is well fit by a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher law. To correlate the observed microscopic dynamics with macroscopic physical properties, temperature-dependent viscosities are also measured. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to study the thermodynamics of the phase transitions from the liquid to supercooled liquid to glassy states. For the two tetraalkylammonium liquids, the observed melting transitions occur near 300 K, so we are able to study the dynamics in a clearly supercooled regime. Very long time scale orientational relaxation time constants dynamics on the order of 100 ns are observed in the C153 fluorescence anisotropy. These are interpreted to arise from long-lived local structures in the environment surrounding the C153 probe.},

abstract = {The morphology of a series of linear poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) zinc-neutralized ionomers with either precisely or randomly spaced acid groups was investigated using X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Scattering from semicrystalline, precise ionomers has contributions from acid layers associated with the crystallites and ionic aggregates dispersed in the amorphous phase. The precisely controlled acid spacing in these ionomers reduces the polydispersity in the aggregate correlation length and yields more intense, well-defined scattering peaks. Remarkably, the ionic aggregates in an amorphous, precise ionomer with 22 mol % acid and 66% neutralization adopt a cubic lattice; this is the first report of ionic aggregate self-assembly onto a lattice in an ionomer with an all-carbon backbone. Aggregate size is insensitive to acid content or neutralization level. As the acid content increases from 9.5 to 22 mol % at approximately 75% neutralization, the number density of aggregates increases by approximately 5 times, suggesting that the ionic aggregates become less ionic with increasing acid content.},

abstract = {2-Acetylcyclopentanone (2-ACP), which is a $\beta$-dicarbonyl compound, undergoes keto-enol isomerization, and its enol tautomers are stabilized by a cyclic intramolecular hydrogen bond. 2-ACP (keto form) has symmetric and asymmetric vibrational modes of the two carbonyl groups at 1748 and 1715 cm(-1) , respectively, which are well separated from the carbonyl modes of its enol tautomers in the FTIR spectrum. We have investigated 2-ACP dissolved in carbon tetrachloride by 2D IR spectroscopy and IR pump-probe spectroscopy. Vibrational population transfer dynamics between the two carbonyl modes were observed by 2D IR spectroscopy. To extract the population exchange dynamics (i.e., the down- and uphill population transfer rate constants), we used the normalized volumes of the cross-peaks with respect to the diagonal peaks at the same emission frequency and the survival and conditional probability functions. As expected, the downhill population transfer time constant (3.2 ps) was measured to be smaller than the uphill population transfer time constant (3.8 ps). In addition, the vibrational population relaxation dynamics of the two carbonyl modes were observed to be the same within the experimental error and were found to be much slower than vibrational population transfer between two carbonyl modes.},

A set of ionogels with different ionic liquid content was studied by DSC and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The nanometric level of the confinement of the ionic liquid turned out to significantly modify the phase transitions, while still allowing some molecular mobility. Moreover, ionogels were found to keep the high conducting performances of the ionic liquid.},

abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy is a versatile technique for probing the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. Simulating infrared absorption spectra with molecular dynamics (MD) offers a powerful means to establish a molecular-level interpretation of experimental results, as well as a basis for the parametrization of more accurate simulation force-fields. Two distinct methods for the calculation of infrared absorption line shapes of high-frequency (Planck's omega/k(B)T>>1) vibrational probes from MD simulations are examined: The classical dipole approximation (CDA) and the fluctuating frequency approximation (FFA). Although these two formalisms result in expressions for the infrared absorption line shape that appear very different, both approximations are shown to yield identical results for the infrared line shape of a harmonic system in the condensed-phase. The equivalence of the FFA and CDA is also demonstrated in the case where the transition dipole of the oscillator fluctuates in response to the environment (i.e., where the Condon approximation has been relaxed). Finally we examine the effects of solute anharmonicity and demonstrate that the CDA and FFA are not equivalent in general, and the magnitude of the deviations increases with anharmonicity. We conclude that the calculation of infrared absorption line shapes via the CDA is a promising alternative to the FFA approach in cases where it may be difficult or undesirable to employ the latter, particularly when the effects of anharmonicity are small.},

abstract = {Dispersed IR three-pulse photon echoes due to the antisymmetric ($\nu$3) stretch mode of N2O dissolved in H2O and 1-octanol at room temperature are reported and analyzed. The experimentally determined transition frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) in these two solvents is explained in terms of inertial solvent contributions, hydrogen bond network fluctuations, and, for octanol, the motions of the alkyl chains. The H2O hydrogen bond fluctuations result in 1.5 ps FFCF decay, in agreement with relaxation rates determined from photon echo based measurements of other aqueous solutions including salt solutions. In octanol, hydrogen bond fluctuations decay on a slower time scale of 3.3 ps and alkyl chain motions result in an inhomogeneous broadening contribution to the $\nu$3 absorption spectrum that decays on a 35 ps time scale. Rotational reorientation of N2O is nearly 3 times faster in octanol as compared to water. Although the vibrational $\nu$3 N2O absorption line shapes in water and octanol are similar, the line widths result from different coherence loss mechanisms. A hot band contribution in the N2O in octanol solution is found to have a significant effect on the echo spectrum due to its correspondingly stronger transition moment than that of the fundamental transition. The dephasing dynamics of the N2O $\nu$3 stretch mode is of interest as a probe in ultrafast studies of complex or nanoconfined systems with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions such as phospholipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. These results demonstrate the value of the N2O molecule to act as a reporter of equilibrium fluctuations in such complex systems particularly due to its solubility characteristics and long vibrational lifetime.},

Crowding results in surprisingly large quantitative effects on both the rates and the equilibria of interactions involving macromolecules, but such interactions are commonly studied outside the cell in uncrowded buffers. The addition of high concentrations of natural and synthetic macromolecules to such buffers enables crowding to be mimicked in vitro, and should be encouraged as a routine variable to study. The stimulation of protein aggregation by crowding might account for the existence of molecular chaperones that combat this effect. Positive results of crowding include enhancing the collapse of polypeptide chains into functional proteins, the assembly of oligomeric structures and the efficiency of action of some molecular chaperones and metabolic pathways.},

A transient thin liquid film method was developed, which enables one to determine the Henry's law constant and the diffusivity at low pressure simultaneously. Measurements were performed at temperatures in the range of 283−323 K. Henry's law constants were in the range of 25.5−84 bar and were in general agreement with measurements reported by other researchers for these and similar ionic liquids. The entropies and enthalpies of absorption were determined to increase as gas solubility decreased. The measured CO2 diffusion coefficients in the five ionic liquids were ∼10-6 cm2/s, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficients for CO2 diffusion in traditional organic solvents. In contrast to the gas solubility results, measured diffusion coefficients were determined to be dependent on the ionic liquid cation as well as the anion. In addition, CO2 diffusion coefficients were considerably more sensitive to temperature than were CO2 solubilities in these ionic liquids. Results were used to develop a correlation relating CO2 diffusion to ionic liquid properties and system temperature.},

Extrapolations via our focal point method yield a C(s)-symmetry global minimum of BH(3)-H(2) type featuring interfragment B-H distances of (1.401, 1.414) A, an H(2) bond length elongated to 0.803 A, and a BH(3)+H(2) dissociation energy D(e)(D(0))=6.6 (1.2) kcal mol(-1). The classical barriers for H(2) internal rotation and hydrogen scrambling are 0.07 and 5.81 kcal mol(-1), respectively, above the BH(5) minimum. Our thermochemical computations yield Delta(f)H(0) ( degrees )[BH(5)(g)]=-111.3+/-0.2 kcal mol(-1)+Delta(f)H(0) ( degrees )[B(g)], which is limited in accuracy only by persistent uncertainties in the enthalpy of formation of gaseous boron.

abstract = {The pH-controlled M2 protein from influenza A is a critical component of the virus and serves as a target for the aminoadamantane antiflu agents that block its H+ channel activity. To better understand its H+ gating mechanism, we investigated M2 in lipid bilayers with a new combination of IR spectroscopies and theory. Linear Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to measure the precise orientation of the backbone carbonyl groups, and 2D infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to identify channel-lining residues. At low pH (open state), our results match previously published solid-state NMR and X-ray structures remarkably well. However, at neutral pH when the channel is closed, our measurements indicate that a large conformational change occurs that is consistent with the transmembrane $\alpha$-helices rotating by one amino acid register—a structural rearrangement not previously observed. The combination of simulations and isotope-labeled FTIR and 2D IR spectroscopies provides a noninvasive means of interrogating the structures of membrane proteins in general and ion channels in particular.},

abstract = {The miscibility of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(vinyl acetate) has been studied. Glass transition temperature measurements indicated that the two polymers are miscible at all compositions. The incompatibility of the two polymers in solution with certain solvents (component 1) has been examined in light of the| $\Delta$x| theory of Patterson et al. Determination of x1i values by the viscometric method using dilute polymer solutions showed that| $\Delta$x| values are too small to enable the theory to predict a phase separation. On the other hand,| $\Delta$x | values large enough to effect a phase separation obtain when solutions infinitely dilute with respect to the solvent molecules were used for the determination of xii values by the inverse gas chromatographic (IGC) method. This calls for taking into account in the theory the composition dependence of x1i. Measurement of thermodynamic interaction parameters by IGC further revealed that miscibility in the binary polymer-polymer mixture is not caused by specific interactions and that there is a lack of “complementary dissimilarity” between the molecules of the two polymers. The LCST's of the polymer blends are probably situated at temperatures much higher than the degradation temperatures of the polymers and could not be determined. Also, no strong dependence of miscibility on molecular weights of the polymers was observed. These results are in agreement with the view that the exchange interaction energy is positive but small, as must be the free volume contribution to the free energy of mixing. {\textcopyright} 1985, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Hydrogen-bonded liquids play a significant role in numerous chemical and biological phenomena. In the past decade, impressive developments in multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy and combined molecular dynamics-quantum mechanical simulation have established many intriguing features of hydrogen bond dynamics in one of the fundamental solvents in nature, water. The next class of a hydrogen-bonded liquid-alcohols-has attracted much less attention. This is surprising given such important differences between water and alcohols as the imbalance between the number of hydrogen bonds, each molecule can accept (two) and donate (one) and the very presence of the hydrophobic group in alcohols. Here, we use polarization-resolved pump-probe and 2D infrared spectroscopy supported by extensive theoretical modeling to investigate hydrogen bond dynamics in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol employing the OH stretching mode as a reporter. The sub-ps dynamics in alcohols are similar to those in water as they are determined by similar librational and hydrogen-bond stretch motions. However, lower density of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in alcohols leads to the appearance of slow diffusion-controlled hydrogen bond exchange dynamics, which are essentially absent in water. We anticipate that the findings herein would have a potential impact on fundamental chemistry and biology as many processes in nature involve the interplay of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups.},

Incorporation of one (18)O allows investigation of the H-bond symmetry by the NMR method of isotopic perturbation. In both CD(3)OD and CD(2)Cl(2) equilibrium isotope shifts are detected at the carboxyl and ipso carbons. Therefore, 1 exists as a pair of interconverting tautomers, not as a single symmetric structure with its hydrogen centered between the two oxygens. The H-bond is instantaneously asymmetric, and there is an equilibrium between solvatomers (isomers or stereoisomers that differ in solvation). The broader implications of this result regarding the role of the local environment ("solvation") in breaking symmetry are discussed.},

abstract = {Experimental studies of solvation dynamics in imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) have revealed complex kinetics over a broad range of time scales from femtoseconds to tens of nanoseconds. Microsecond-length molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of coumarin 153 (C153) in 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [emim][BF4], were performed to reveal the molecular-level mechanism for solvation dynamics in imidazolium-based ILs over the full range of time scales accessed in the experiments. The solvation response of C153 in [emim][BF4] compared favorably with experiment. An analysis of the structure of the IL in the vicinity of the C153 dye revealed preferential solvation by the [emim] cations. Despite this observation, decomposition of the solvation response into components from the anions and cations and also from translational and rotational motions shows that translations of the [BF4] anions are the dominant contributor to solvation dynamics. The kinetics for the translation of the [BF4] anions into and out of the first solvation shell of the dye were found to mimic the kinetic profile of the solvation dynamics response. This mechanism for solvation dynamics contrasts dramatically with conventional polar liquids in which solvent rotations are generally responsible for the response.},

abstract = {Previously we have shown that organic solutes can be extracted from ionic liquids (ILs) with supercritical CO2 and that ILs can be induced to separate from organic and aqueous mixtures by applying gaseous CO2 pressure. Thus, we are interested in the solvent strength of IL/CO2 mixtures. Here we use 4-nitroaniline, N,N-diethyl-4-nitroaniline and Reichardt's dye 33 to determine the Kamlet–Taft parameters for four different imidazolium based ILs and their mixtures with CO2 at 25 and 40 °C. The effect of temperature and carbon dioxide concentration on these parameters was determined. The polarizability parameter depends weakly on the CO2 concentration. However, the hydrogen bond donating ability and the hydrogen bond accepting ability are virtually independent of CO2 pressure. The results indicate that the strong interactions between ILs and probe molecules are not influenced by CO2.},

abstract = {Functionalized organic monolayers deposited on planar two-dimensional surfaces are important systems for studying ultrafast orientational motions and structures of interfacial molecules. Several studies have successfully observed the orientational relaxation of functionalized monolayers by fluorescence depolarization experiments and recently by polarization-resolved heterodyne detected vibrational transient grating (HDTG) experiments. In this article we provide a model-independent theory to extract orientational correlation functions unique to interfacial molecules and other uniaxial systems based on polarization-resolved resonant third-order spectroscopies, such as pump-probe spectroscopy, HDTG spectroscopy, and fluorescence depolarization experiment. It will be shown (in the small beam-crossing angle limit) that five measurements are necessary to completely characterize the monolayer's motions: I(∥)(t) and I(⊥)(t) with the incident beams normal to the surface, I(∥)(t) and I(⊥)(t) with a non-zero incident angle, and a time averaged linear dichroism measurement. Once these measurements are performed, two orientational correlation functions corresponding to in-plane and out-of-plane motions are obtained. The procedure is applicable not only for monolayers on flat surfaces, but any samples with uniaxial symmetry such as uniaxial liquid crystals and aligned planar bilayers. The theory is valid regardless of the nature of the actual molecular motions on interface. We then apply the general results to wobbling-in-a-cone model, in which molecular motions are restricted to a limited range of angles. Within the context of the model, the cone angle, the tilt of the cone relative to the surface normal, and the orientational diffusion constant can be determined. The results are extended to describe analysis of experiments where the beams are not crossing in the small angle limit.},

Ionic recognition depends upon the rate and mechanism by which ligands enter and leave the first solvation shell surrounding these cations. We present a time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy study of these ligand exchange dynamics in aqueous solution. The sensitivity of the CN-stretch frequency of NCS(-) to ion pair formation has been utilized to investigate the mechanism and dynamics of ligand exchange into and out of the first solvation shell of aqueous magnesium and calcium ions with multidimensional vibrational (2DIR) spectroscopy. We have determined that anion exchange follows a dissociative mechanism for Mg(2+) and an associative mechanism for Ca(2+).},

abstract = {The selectivity filter of K+ channels comprises four contiguous ion binding sites, S1 through S4. Structural and functional data indicate that the filter contains on average two K+ ions at any given time and that these ions reside primarily in two configurations, namely to sites S1 and S3 or to sites S2 and S4. Maximum ion flux through the channel is expected to occur when the energy difference between these two binding configurations is zero. In this study, we have used protein semisynthesis to selectively perturb site 1 within the filter of the KcsA channel through use of an amide-to-ester substitution. The modification alters K+ conduction properties. The structure of the selectivity filter is largely unperturbed by the modification, despite the loss of an ordered water molecule normally located just behind the filter. Introduction of the ester moiety was found to alter the distribution of K+, Rb+, and Cs+ within the filter, with the most dramatic change found for Rb+. The redistribution of ions is associated with the appearance of a partially hydrated ion just external to the filter, at a position where no ion is observed in the wild-type channel. The appearance of this new ion-binding site creates a change in the distance between a pair of K+ ions some fraction of the time, apparently leading to a reduction in the ion conduction rate. Importantly, this finding suggests that the selectivity filter of a potassium channel is optimized both in terms of absolute ion occupancy and in terms of the separation in distance between the conducting ions.},

The studies were performed by a novel multinuclear pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR technique, which combines the advantages of a high magnetic field (17.6 T) and a high magnetic field gradient (up to 30 T/m), in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. In general, a satisfactory agreement was observed between the experimental and simulation diffusion data. Under all conditions examined, the self-diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide were found to be approximately an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding self-diffusion coefficients of the ions. It was observed that an increase in temperature and in the amount of carbon dioxide in the ionic liquid led to an increase in the ion self-diffusivities without changing the relationship between the self-diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions. An observation of a slightly higher diffusivity of the cations in comparison to that of the anions is attributed to the preferential mobility of the cations in the direction of the ring plane. The diffusion activation energies of the ions were found to decrease gradually with an increase of the carbon dioxide content in the ionic liquid. The activation energy of the carbon dioxide diffusion in all cases was found to be smaller than those of the ions. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is an important analytical tool in monitoring properties of systems for that water is a major constituent. For such objects of analysis a quality of information extracted from the NIR spectra depends essentially on used methods of analysis of a massive absorbance of water. Correctly chosen method should be able to identified rational number of overlapped components hidden under the broad band of water. The resolved components have to be justified on grounds of the structure of water and by relation to the properties a hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules. The interest in the correlation is imposed by a fact that hydrogen bonds of water around nonpolar group are significantly strengthened and weakened around polar groups. Intensity variations classified in this context could be valuable source of information on varying properties of the solute molecules embedded in water environment. Therefore, there is a big interest in methods that have a power for detailed analysis of the intensity changes in the broad NIR spectra. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) and principal component analysis (PCA) are our proposition. In the analysis of the temperature-dependent NIR spectra of water by means of the two methods we have focused on the interpretation of the 2DCOS results through the concept of linear and nonlinear relationships. Moreover, a cascaded curve fitting procedure has been employed. Presented approach should be very instructive of how to interpret the features of the 2D results that frequently is not a straightforward task. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Potassium channels are K+-selective protein pores in cell membrane. The selectivity filter is the functional unit that allows K+ channels to distinguish potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. The filter's structure depends on whether K+ or Na+ ions are bound inside it. We synthesized a K+ channel containing the D-enantiomer of alanine in place of a conserved glycine and found by x-ray crystallography that its filter maintains the K+ (conductive) structure in the presence of Na+ and very low concentrations of K+. This channel conducts Na+ in the absence of K+ but not in the presence of K+. These findings demonstrate that the ability of the channel to adapt its structure differently to K+ and Na+ is a fundamental aspect of ion selectivity, as is the ability of multiple K+ ions to compete effectively with Na+ for the conductive filter.},

Absorption spectra were obtained mainly for physiological relevant pH region. Intense bands for aromatic amino acids, histidine and such with OH group could clearly be identified throughout the given spectral region. For sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine some strong bands besides the weak carbon-sulfur stretching vibration was shown. Effects of aqueous solution environment, pH, protonation states were discussed, together with previously reported data from theoretical approaches. With this complete set of spectral information application to proteins in the whole mid infrared region could be described precise and the potential of the lower spectral region to study typical cofactor ligands like histidine, shown. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most of the electrocatalytic processes of interest in the resolution of modern energy challenges are associated with proton transfer. In the cases where heavy atom bond cleavage occurs concomitantly, the question arises of the exact nature of its coupling with proton-electron transfer within the catalytic cycle. The cleavage of a C-O bond in the catalyzed electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO offers the opportunity to address this question. Electrochemically generated iron(0) porphyrins are efficient, specific, and durable catalysts provided they are coupled with Lewis or Br{\"{o}}nsted acids. The cocatalyst properties of four Br{\"{o}}nsted acids of increasing strength, water, trifluoroethanol, phenol, and acetic acid, have been systematically investigated. Preparative-scale electrolyses showed that carbon monoxide is the only product of the catalytic reaction. Methodic application of a nondestructive technique, cyclic voltammetry, with catalyst and CO2 concentrations, as well as H/D isotope effect, as diagnostic parameters allowed the dissection of the reaction mechanism. It appears that the key step of the reaction sequence consists of an electron transfer from the catalyst concerted with the cleavage of a C-O bond and the transfer of one proton. This is the second example, and an intermolecular version of such a concerted proton-electron bond-breaking reaction after a similar electrochemical process involving the cleavage of O-O bonds has been identified. It is the first time that a proton-electron transfer concerted with bond breaking has been uncovered as the crucial step in a catalytic multistep reaction.},

It is found that the mixture shows preferential solvation, which is mainly controlled by the solute-BMI+PF6- electrostatic interactions and thus dictates differing roles for CO2 as the solute charge distribution varies. The local structure and density of BMI+PF6- and CO2 in the vicinity of the solute become enhanced and reduced, respectively, as its dipole moment increases. As a result, equilibrium solvation dynamics of a nonpolar solute in the mixture have a strong CO2 character, whereas those of a dipolar solute are very similar to, albeit faster than, solvation dynamics in pure BMI+PF6-. Related nonequilibrium solvent response couched in dynamic Stokes shifts and accompanying solvation structure relaxation, in particular, CO2 structure reorganization, shows interesting dependence on the solute charge distribution. Ion transport in the mixture is much faster than in pure BMI+PF6-, indicating that the addition of cosolvent CO2 reduces the viscosity of the ionic liquid, significantly. The effective polarity of the mixture, measured as solvation-induced stabilization of a dipolar solute, is found to be comparable to that of neat BMI+PF6-, consonant with solvatochromic measurements.},

abstract = {In "outer sphere" electron transfer reactions, motions of the solvent molecules surrounding the donor and acceptor govern the dynamics of charge flow. Are the relevant solvent motions determined simply by bulk solvent properties such as dielectric constant or viscosity? Or are molecular details, such as the local solvent structure around the donor and acceptor, necessary to understand how solvent motions control charge transfer? In this paper, we address these questions by using ultrafast spectroscopy to study a photoinduced electron transfer reaction with only electronic degrees of freedom: the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) reaction of Na(-) (sodide). Photoexcitation of Na(-) places the excited CTTS electron into a solvent-bound excited state; motions of the surrounding solvent molecules in response to this excitation ultimately lead to detachment of the electron. The detached electron can then localize either in an "immediate" contact pair (in the same cavity as the Na atom), which undergoes back electron transfer to regenerate Na(-) in similar to1 ps, or in a "solvent-separated" contact pair (one solvent shell away from the Na atom), which undergoes back electron transfer in tens to hundreds of picoseconds. We present detailed results for the dynamics of each step of this reaction in several solvents: the ethers tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and tetrahydropyran and the amine solvent hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). The results are interpreted in terms of a kinetic model that both incorporates spectral shifting of the reaction intermediates due to solvation dynamics and accounts for anisotropic spectral diffusion in polarized transient hole-burning experiments. We find that the rate of CTTS detachment does not correlate simply with any bulk solvent properties, but instead appears to depend on the details of how the solvent packs around the solute. In contrast, the rate for back electron transfer of solvent-separated contact pairs varies inversely with solvent polarity, indicating a barrier to recombination and suggesting that this reaction lies in the Marcus inverted regime. For immediate contact pairs, the rate of recombination varies directly with solvent polarity in the ethers but is slowest in the highly polar solvent HMPA, suggesting that the spatial extent of the solvated electron in each solvent is one of the major factors determining the recombination dynamics. The fact that each step in the reaction varies with solvent in a different way implies that there is not a single set of solvent motions or spectral density that can be used to model all aspects of electron transfer. In addition, all of the results and conclusions in this paper are compared in detail to related work on this system by Ruhman and co-workers; in particular, we assign a fast decay seen in the near-IR to solvation of the CTTS p-to-p excited-state absorption, and polarization differences observed at visible probe wavelengths to anisotropic bleaching of the Na(-) CTTS ground state.

To probe the transition state of ubiquitin thermal unfolding, we examine unfolding dynamics and kinetics of wild-type and mutant ubiquitin using time-resolved nonlinear infrared spectroscopy after a nanosecond temperature jump. We observe spectral changes on two different time scales. A fast nonexponential microsecond phase is attributed to downhill unfolding from the transition state region, which is induced by a shift of the barrier due to the rapid temperature change. Slow millisecond changes arise from thermally activated folding and unfolding kinetics. Mutants that stabilize or destabilize beta strands III-V lead to a decreased or increased amplitude of the microsecond phase, indicating that the disruption or weakening of these strands occurs in the transition state. Unfolding features from microseconds to milliseconds can be explained by temperature-dependent changes of a two-dimensional free energy surface constructed by the native contacts between beta strands of the protein. In addition, the results support the possibility of an intermediate state in thermal unfolding.},

In this new investigation, the excited-state behavior of DCM-crown complexed with a strontium ion in acetonitrile is found to exhibit the same trends as those previously reported with calcium and lithium ions. However, some new features provide evidence for cation photorelease to the bulk. Subpicosecond transient absorption experiments confirm the initial fast photodisruption of the interaction between the ion and the crown, and the formation of a loose complex after intramolecular charge transfer within the chromophore. Two additional steps are observed. Firstly, a continuous red shift of the gain spectrum is seen on the subnanosecond scale. It is assigned to the movement of the Sr2+ cation away from the chromophore, partly to the bulk of the solvent and partly towards the formation of an ultraloose complex with oxygen atoms of the crown. Secondly, a free-ligand-like absorption remains after the complete decay of the excited state. This band, which signals a total photorelease of the Sr2+ ion, disappears with a characteristic time of about 110 ns, attributed to the recomplexation of the crown in the ground state of the dye.},

abstract = {We report molecular dynamics studies on the solvation of sodium chloride in the 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid ([BMI][Tf2N] IL). We first consider the potential of mean force for dissociating a single Na+Cl- ion pair, showing that the latter prefers to be undissociated rather than dissociated (by ca. 9 kcal/mol), with a free energy barrier of ca. 5 kcal/mol (at d approximately 5.2 A) for the association process. The preference for Na+Cl- association is also observed from a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation of a concentrated solution, where the Na+Cl- ions tend to form oligomers and microcrystals in the IL. Conversely, the simulation of Na13Cl14- and Na14Cl13+ cubic microcrystals (with, respectively, Cl- and Na+ at the vertices) does not lead to dissolution in the IL. Among these, Na14Cl13+ is found to be better solvated than Na13Cl14-, mainly due to the stronger Na+...Tf2N- interactions as compared to the Cl-...BMI+ interactions at the vertices of the cube. We finally consider the solid/liquid interface between the 100 face of NaCl and the IL, revealing that, in spite of its polar nature, the crystal surface is solvated by the less polar IL components (CF3(Tf2N) and butyl(BMI) groups) rather than by the polar ones (O(Tf2N) and imidazolium(BMI) ring). Specific ordering at the interface is described for both Tf2N- anions and BMI+ cations. In the first IL layer, the ions are rather parallel to the surface, whereas in the second "layer" they are more perpendicular. A similar IL structure is found at the surface of the all-neutral Na0Cl0 solid analogue, confirming that the solvation of the crystal is rather "apolar", due to the mismatch between the IL and the crystal ions. Several comparisons with water, methanol, or different BMI+-based ILs as solvents are presented, allowing us to better understand the specificity of the ionic liquid-NaCl interactions.},

abstract = {The off-diagonal anharmonicity for a pair of vibrational modes, determined as a shift of their combination level, $\Delta$(12), can be linked to the molecular structure via modeling. The anharmonicity, $\Delta$(12), also determines the amplitude and shape of the cross-peak between modes 1 and 2 measured using 2DIR spectroscopy. For large anharmonicities, the anharmonicity value can be readily obtained from the shape of the cross peak. In practice, however, the anharmonicities are often small (≪1 cm(-1)). In this case, the amplitude of the cross peak rather than its shape is sensitive to the anharmonicity value, and determination of the anharmonicity requires absolute cross-peak measurements. We proposed and tested a new approach of determining anharmonicities, which is based on sensitivity of high-frequency vibrational modes to temperature. The approach permits calibrating the cross-peak amplitude in terms of the effective anharmonicity resulting from the thermal excitation of lower-frequency vibrational modes. It relies on a series of relative 2DIR measurements. While the sensitivity of the method depends on various specific parameters of the molecular system, such as transition dipoles and temperature sensitivity of the high-frequency modes involved, we have estimated that the anharmonicities as small as 0.02 cm(-1) can be determined for the cross peaks between -N(3) and C═O stretching modes using this approach.},

Atomistic and coarse-grained molecular models predict qualitatively different results for the scaling of chain size with molecular weight, and experiments on dilute solutions are not available. In this work, we develop a first-principles force field for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in the ionic liquid 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]) using symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). At temperatures above 400 K, simulations employing both the SAPT and OPLS-AA force fields predict that PEO displays ideal chain behavior, in contrast to previous simulations at lower temperature. We therefore argue that the system shows a transition from extended to more compact configurations as the temperature is increased from room temperature to the experimental lower critical solution temperature. Although polarization is shown to be important, its implicit inclusion in the OPLS-AA force is sufficient to describe the structure and energetics of the mixture. The simulations emphasize the difference between ionic liquids from typical solvents for polymers.},

abstract = {We combine direct surface force measurements with thermodynamic arguments to demonstrate that pure ionic liquids are expected to behave as dilute weak electrolyte solutions, with typical effective dissociated ion concentrations of less than 0.1% at room temperature. We performed equilibrium force-distance measurements across the common ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C4mim][NTf2]) using a surface forces apparatus with in situ electrochemical control and quantitatively modeled these measurements using the van der Waals and electrostatic double-layer forces of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory with an additive repulsive steric (entropic) ion-surface binding force. Our results indicate that ionic liquids screen charged surfaces through the formation of both bound (Stern) and diffuse electric double layers, where the diffuse double layer is comprised of effectively dissociated ionic liquid ions. Additionally, we used the energetics of thermally dissociating ions in a dielectric medium to quantitatively predict the equilibrium for the effective dissociation reaction of [C4mim][NTf2] ions, in excellent agreement with the measured Debye length. Our results clearly demonstrate that, outside of the bound double layer, most of the ions in [C4mim][NTf2] are not effectively dissociated and thus do not contribute to electrostatic screening. We also provide a general, molecular-scale framework for designing ionic liquids with significantly increased dissociated charge densities via judiciously balancing ion pair interactions with bulk dielectric properties. Our results clear up several inconsistencies that have hampered scientific progress in this important area and guide the rational design of unique, high-free-ion density ionic liquids and ionic liquid blends.},

abstract = {We have investigated the performance of eight popular density functionals{,} four of which are “standard” functionals not including dispersion (B3LYP{,} BP86{,} PBE{,} and TPSS) and four of which have been constructed to account for dispersion (B97D{,} wB97XD{,} M06{,} and M06L){,} in reproducing 18 molecular structures derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments on ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalyst precursors. Our analysis of all the internuclear distances reveals that standard DFT predicts systematically expanded structures. In contrast{,} all the methods accounting for dispersion give rise to more compact structures{,} removing the systematic overestimation of internuclear distances. The contracting effect of dispersion is general and also affects chemical bonds{,} thus reducing the general overestimation of bond lengths. The best overall performance is observed for wB97XD{,} which offers relatively small statistical errors when considering the overall structure as well as selected distances. Only for the coordination center geometry is the accuracy of wB97XD matched by standard functionals such as PBE and TPSS{,} whereas M06 and M06L are associated with larger errors. At the other end of the scale{,} B3LYP is seen to give the largest statistical errors in general{,} both when considering the complete structures and the geometries of the coordination centers alone. For the organic ligands{,} however{,} B3LYP performs clearly better than the other standard functionals although not as well as the functionals accounting for dispersion. Extending the basis sets is seen to improve the structures in particular of the coordination center{,} thus underlining the importance of using sufficiently flexible basis sets if highly accurate geometries are to be obtained. Similar conclusions to those obtained for the ruthenium catalysts can be drawn from comparisons of the X-ray crystal structures of 10 other organometallic complexes of relevance to homogeneous catalysis{,} covering first (Ti{,} Fe{,} Co{,} Ni){,} second (Zr{,} Mo{,} Rh{,} Pd) and third (W{,} Ir) row transition metals{,} with those of DFT. The latter analyses thus offer a first indication that the picture obtained for the ruthenium alkylidene complexes may be extended to other classes of relatively large transition metal complexes.},

abstract = {The secondary structures of calmodulin and parvalbumin are well established from X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies, which indicate that these proteins are predominantly alpha-helical in character. Recent infrared studies have nevertheless suggested that the helical structures present in these proteins in solution are not the standard alpha-helix but rather some kind of distorted helices [Trewhella, J., et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1294]. The evidence for this was the unusually low amide I frequency for calmodulin and troponin C in 2H2O solution. The studies presented here, however, suggest that the helical structures in these proteins are not significantly distorted, for two reasons. First, distorted helical structures have weaker hydrogen bonds than the standard alpha-helix and would therefore be expected to absorb at a higher rather than a lower frequency. Second, distorted helical structures would absorb at an unusual frequency in H2O solutions which is not the case for the proteins studied here. The band frequency of these proteins is observed to occur at a frequency observed with other proteins known to contain predominantly alpha-helical structures. Quantitative analysis of the FT-IR spectra of calmodulin (67% alpha-helix) and parvalbumin (68% alpha-helix) in H2O in the presence of Ca2+ gives helical contents similar to those reported by X-ray studies. This raises the question as to why these proteins in H2O show a normal frequency for the presence of alpha-helical structures and an abnormal frequency in 2H2O. Addition of deuterated glycerol to the proteins in 2H2O solutions results in a significant shift of absorbance to higher frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Polarization plays a central role in the measurement and interpretation of 2D IR spectra. In standard pump-probe spectroscopies, polarization has been used for many years to measure the rotational times of molecules or eliminate rotational motion from dynamics measurements. The polarization dependence of the diagonal peaks provide the same capabilities, but polarization can do much more in 2D and 3D spectroscopies. Recall Fig. 4.11 from Chapter 4, which is a schematic of a rephasing 2D IR spectrum with each peak labeled by its respective Feynman pathway. The objective of using polarization in 2D IR spectroscopy is to enhance or suppress particular Feynman pathways based on the relative angles of the transition dipoles. Selection is possible because each Feynman pathway has a different ordering of quantum states (e.g. j → j → i → i versus j → i → j → i). Thus, the ordering of polarized pulses in a pulse sequence will scale one pathway differently from another, thereby altering the intensities and phases of the diagonal and cross-peaks. By measuring these effects, the relative angles between transition dipoles can be measured [69, 190, 202]. Angles are an extremely insightful tool for monitoring the structures of molecules, perhaps more so than actual couplings. In fact, properly polarized pulses can actually eliminate the diagonal peaks from the 2D IR spectra [201], thereby better resolving the cross-peaks, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Suppressing the diagonal peaks is a particularly important capability since the diagonal peaks often obscure the much weaker cross-peaks. Polarization will play an even more important role in 3D and higher-order spectroscopies [43]. In what follows, we take a stepwise approach to polarization control by introducing key concepts one at a time. 5.1 Using polarization to manipulate the molecular response To begin, we expand some of the equations we used in earlier chapters. We now need to explicitly take into account that the electric fields of the laser pulses are vectorial (Eq. 2.1): 88},

The amide-I band exhibits a double peak structure, which has been attributed to different mechanisms including vibrational self-trapping, a Fermi resonance, or the existence of two conformational substates. The 2D-IR spectrum of crystalline acetanilide is compared with that of two different molecular systems: (i) benzoylchloride, which exhibits a strong symmetric Fermi resonance and (ii) N-methylacetamide dissolved in methanol which occurs in two spectroscopically distinguishable conformations. Both 2D-IR spectra differ significantly from that of crystalline acetanilide, proving that these two alternative mechanisms cannot account for the anomalous spectroscopy of crystalline acetanilide. On the other hand, vibrational self-trapping of the amide-I band can naturally explain the 2D-IR response.},

Marked changes in the bands associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of the carboxylate groups induced by metal-ion binding could be discerned for PAL/ODS self-assembled bilayers (SABs) in contact with Cd2+ solutions of pH = 6 even at concentrations in the sub-$\mu$M range. Subsequent exposure of Cd2+/PAL/ODS SABs to solutions of pH < 4 devoid of Cd2+ led to the removal of Cd2+ from the bilayer leaving behind a better ordered structure, as judged by the shift of the C−H stretching modes toward lower wavenumbers. Spectral evidence for strong metal−terminal sulfonate group interactions was also obtained for HDSA/ODS SABs immersed in solutions containing Cd2+, Fe3+, and Fe2+, for which the effects on the characteristic symmetric and asymmetric modes of the terminal sulfonate moieties were found to be unique to the nature of each of the metal ions.},

While charge transfer drives the static frequency shift between dif ferent ionic liquids (J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 142, 212425), we find here that electrostatic and Pauli repulsion effects dominate the dynamical frequency shift between different geometries sampled from the finite-temperature dynamics within a single ionic liquid. This finding is also surprising because dispersion interactions dominate the CO2−IL interaction energies, but are comparably constant across different geometries. An important practical consequence of this finding is that density functional theory is expected to be sufficiently accurate for constructing potential energy surfaces for CO2 in [C4C1IM][PF6], as needed for accurate anharmonic calculations to construct a reliable spectroscopic map. Similarly, we established appropriate computational and chemical models for treating the extended solvent environment. We found that a QM/MM treatment including at least 2 cation-ion pairs at the QM level and at least 32 pairs at the MM level is necessary to converge vibrational frequencies to within 1 cm−1. Using these insights, this work identifies a computational protocol as well as a chemical model necessary to construct accurate spectroscopic maps from first principles.},

Owing to the presence of these convertible protonation forms, histidine plays important: roles in proton-transfer reactions in various enzymes. Vibrational spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods to study the protonation state of histidine in proteins. For systematic investigation of IR and Raman markers of the protonation state of histidine, we have performed ab initio normal-mode calculations using the density function theory (DFT) method for all of the four protonation forms of 4-methylimidazole (a simple model compound of a histidine side chain) and their N-deuterated analogues. FTIR and Raman spectra of all of these compounds were measured, and the observed bands were assigned according to the calculated frequencies and intensities. Differences in the optimized geometries and changes in the vibrational couplings explained the differences in band frequencies and N-deuteration shifts among the protonation forms. These analyses provided theoretical bases for the IR and Raman markers of the protonation state, including known markers, such as the C4C5 stretching and the C5N1 stretching bands, as well as some new potential markers.},

abstract = {When reorientation of a vibrational chromophore is faster than the relaxation of its local environment, the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) measured by two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) spectroscopy is an interplay of scalar structural spectral diffusion and vectorial reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD). Theory has been established to calculate the RISD component of different polarization configurations with the assumption that the molecule orients randomly in a local electric field. We show here that in the [BMIM][SCN]/AOT/chlorobenzene system, where the local electric field is strong, this assumption is incapable of reproducing the experimental results. We modify the current theory by assuming a Boltzmann distribution of transition dipoles of the chromophores in a local electric field and use a Markov chain model to calculate the RISD component of 2D-IR with different polarization configurations. The result reproduces key features of the experiment and suggests a potential ion-exchange in the [BMIM][SCN]/AOT/chlorobenzene system.},

abstract = {New, hydrophobic ionic liquids with low melting points (<-30 °C to ambient temperature) have been synthesized and investigated, based on 1,3-dialkyl imidazolium cations and hydrophobic anions. Other imidazolium molten salts with hydrophilic anions and thus water-soluble are also described. The molten salts were characterized by NMR and elemental analysis. Their density, melting point, viscosity, conductivity, refractive index, electrochemical window, thermal stability, and miscibility with water and organic solvents were determined. The influence of the alkyl substituents in 1, 2, 3, and 4(5)-positions on these properties was scrutinized. Viscosities as low as 35 cP (for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (bis(triflyl)amide) and trifluoroacetate) and conductivities as high as 9.6 mS/cm were obtained. Photophysical probe studies were carried out to establish more precisely the solvent properties of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide). The hydrophobic molten salts are promising solvents for electrochemical, photovoltaic, and synthetic applications.},

abstract = {Abiogenic lead (Pb ), present in the environment in elevated levels due to human activities, has detrimental effects on human health. Metal-binding sites in proteins have been identified as primary targets for lead substitution resulting in malfunction of the host protein. Although Pb is known to be a potent competitor of Ca in protein binding sites, why/how Pb can compete with Ca in proteins remains unclear, raising multiple outstanding questions, including the following: (1) What are the physicochemical factors governing the competition between Pb and Ca ? (2) Which Ca -binding sites in terms of the structure, composition, overall charge, flexibility, and solvent exposure are the most likely targets for Pb attack? Using density functional theory combined with polarizable continuum model calculations, we address these questions by studying the thermodynamic outcome of the competition between Pb and Ca in various model Ca -binding sites, including those modeling voltage-gated calcium channel selectivity filters and EF-hand and non-EF-hand Ca -binding sites. The results, which are in good agreement with experiment, reveal that the metal site's flexibility and number of amino acid ligands dictate the outcome of the competition between Pb and Ca : If the Ca -binding site is relatively rigid and crowded with protein ligands, then Pb , upon binding, preserves the native metal-binding site geometry and at low concentrations, can act as an activator of the host protein. If the Ca -binding site is flexible and consists of only a few protein ligands, then Pb can displace Ca and deform the native metal-binding site geometry, resulting in protein malfunction.},

abstract = {Heatwaves have become more frequent in the United States since the 1960s, while extreme cold temperatures and cold waves are less frequent. Recent record-setting hot years are projected to be-come common in the near future for the United States, as annual average temperatures continue to rise. Annual average temperature over the contiguous United States has increased by 1.8°F (1.0°C) for the period 1901–2016; over the next few decades (2021–2050), annual average temperatures are expected to rise by about 2.5°F for the United States, relative to the recent past (average from 1976–2005), under all plausible future climate scenarios. The incidence of large forest fires in the western United States and Alaska has increased since the early 1980s and is projected to further increase in those regions as the climate changes, with profound changes to regional ecosystems. Annual trends toward earlier spring melt and reduced snowpack are already affecting water re-sources in the western United States and these trends are expected to continue. Under higher scenar-ios, and assuming no change to current water resources management, chronic, long-duration hydro-logical drought is increasingly possible before the end of this century. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally. Without major reduc-tions in emissions, the increase in annual average global temperature relative to preindustrial times could reach 9°F (5°C) or more by the end of this century. With significant reductions in emissions, the increase in annual average global temperature could be limited to 3.6°F (2°C) or less. The global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration has now passed 400 parts per million (ppm), a level that last occurred about 3 million years ago, when both global average tempera-ture and sea level were significantly higher than today. Continued growth in CO 2 emissions over this century and beyond would lead to an atmospheric concentration not experienced in tens to hundreds of millions of years. There is broad consensus that the further and the faster the Earth system is pushed towards warming, the greater the risk of unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are poten-tially large and irreversible. The observed increase in carbon emissions over the past 15–20 years has been consistent with higher emissions pathways. In 2014 and 2015, emission growth rates slowed as economic growth became less carbon-intensive. Even if this slowing trend continues, however, it is not yet at a rate that would limit global average temperature change to well below 3.6°F (2°C) above preindustrial levels.},

abstract = {Isotope exchange at the histidine C2 atom of imidazole in D2O solution is well known to occur at a significantly slower rate than the exchange of amide protons. Analysis of the kinetics of this isotope-exchange reaction is proposed herein as a method of detecting histidine phosphorylation. This modification of His-containing peptides is challenging to pinpoint because of its instability under acidic conditions as well as during CID-MS analysis. In this work, we investigated the effect of phosphorylation of the histidine side chain in peptides on deuterium-hydrogen exchange (DHX) in the imidazole. The results demonstrate that phosphorylation dramatically slows the rate of the DHX reaction. This phenomenon can be applied to detect phosphorylation of peptides at the histidine residue (e.g., in enzymatic digests). We also found that the influence of the peptide sequence on the exchange kinetics is relatively small. A CID fragmentation experiment revealed that there was no detectable hydrogen scrambling in peptides deuterated at C2 of the imidazole ring. Therefore, MS/MS can be used to directly identify the locations of deuterium ions incorporated into peptides containing multiple histidine moieties.},

abstract = {The ability to interpret experimental data is essential to understanding and participating in the process of scientific discovery. Reading primary research articles can be a frustrating experience for undergraduate biology students because they have very little experience interpreting data. To enhance their data interpretation skills, students used a template called "Figure Facts" to assist them with primary literature-based reading assignments in an advanced cellular neuroscience course. The Figure Facts template encourages students to adopt a data-centric approach, rather than a text-based approach, to understand research articles. Specifically, Figure Facts requires students to focus on the experimental data presented in each figure and identify specific conclusions that may be drawn from those results. Students who used Figure Facts for one semester increased the amount of time they spent examining figures in a primary research article, and regular exposure to primary literature was associated with improved student performance on a data interpretation skills test. Students reported decreased frustration associated with interpreting data figures, and their opinions of the Figure Facts template were overwhelmingly positive. In this paper, we present Figure Facts for others to adopt and adapt, with reflection on its implementation and effectiveness in improving undergraduate science education.},

We were able to do so with the use of two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy, an ultrafast vibrational analog of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The equilibrium dynamics of phenol complexation to benzene in a benzene-carbon tetrachloride solvent mixture were measured in real time by the appearance of off-diagonal peaks in the two-dimensional vibrational echo spectrum of the phenol hydroxyl stretch. The dissociation time constant tau(d) for the phenol-benzene complex was 8 picoseconds. Adding two electron-donating methyl groups to the benzene nearly tripled the value of tau(d) and stabilized the complex, whereas bromobenzene, with an electron-withdrawing bromo group, formed a slightly weaker complex with a slightly lower tau(d). The spectroscopic method holds promise for studying a wide variety of other fast chemical exchange processes.},

We found that the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium salt shows the highest ionic conductivity among ionic liquids free from halogenated anions (3.6 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C), and the elongation of the alkyl chain causes the pronounced depression of fluidity and ionic conductivity. Also, such an elongation gives rise to the increase in the degree of ion association in the liquids, mainly caused by the van der Waals interactions between alkyl chains. N(CN)2 salts with 1-ethyl-2-methylpyrazolium (EMP) and N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PY(12)) cations as well as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI) cation are liquids at room temperature (RT), while the N-ethylthiazolium salt shows a melting event at higher temperature (57 degrees C). Among the three RT ionic liquids with ethyl-containing cations, RT ionic conductivity follows the order EMI > PY(12) > EMP, which does not coincide with the order of fluidity at RT (EMI > EMP > PY(12)). Such a discrepancy is originated from a high degree of ion dissociation in the PY(12) salt, which was manifested in the Walden rule deviation and solvatochromic effects. A series of N(CN)2/C(CN)3 binary mixtures of the EMI salts were also prepared. RT ionic conductivity decreases linearly with increasing the molar fraction of C(CN)3 anion.},

We compared structural and dynamical properties of these liquids and we find that the [SCN]-based ionic liquid is much more prone to $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking interactions as opposed to the other two ionic liquids contrary to the fact that all liquids bear the same cation. Hydrogen bonding is strong in the dicyanamide- and the thiocyanate-based ionic liquids and it is almost absent in the tetracyanoborate liquid. The anion prefers to stay on-top of the imidazolium ring with the highest priority for the [N(CN)2](-) anion followed by the [B(CN)4](-) anion. We find that experimental viscosity trends cannot be correlated to the hydrogen bond dynamics which is fastest for [B(CN)4](-) followed by [SCN](-) and [N(CN)2](-). The cation-anion ion pair dynamics is mainly governed by the on-top dynamics of the anion. For the dynamics of the cation on-top of itself we find the order of [B(CN)4](-) followed by [N(CN)2](-) and finally by [SCN](-) . Interestingly, this trend correlates well with the viscosity suggesting a correlation between the cation-cation interaction dynamics with the viscosity at least for these cyano-based ionic liquids. These findings, especially the apparent correlation between cation-cation dynamics and the viscosity, might be useful for the suggestion of better ionic liquids in electrolyte applications.},

abstract = {Rates of 78 bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and elimination (E2) reactions in solvents water, methanol, formamide, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), sulfolane (TMS), aceto- nitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMePy), acetone, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPT), nitromethane, and 80% v :v DMSO-methanol are considered. Solvent effects on rate are interpreted in terms of solvent activity coefficients, with methanol as reference solvent, for reactants and for transition states. If our extrathermodynamic assumptions are valid, then solvation of small, “hard” reactant anions (e.g., Cl-) decreases strongly in the order of solvents: HzO > MeOH > HCONHz >> DMSO, CHsN02 > CHICN, DMF > TMS > DMAC > HMPT, NMePy. Solvation of polar reactants (e.g., CHd) and uncharged transition states de- creases slightly and roughly in the order of solvents: HMPT, NMePy > DMSO; DMAC, DMF > CHICN > CHINO2 > MeOH > HCONH2 >> HzO; solvation of large polarizable SNAr transition state anions decreases in the order HMPT, DMSO > DMF > CHIOH, NMePy > CHINOZ, CHCN, just as does a “model” trans- ition state anion. Evidence is presented for the following observations, which are independent of extrathermo- dynamic assumptions. Solvation of SN$\sim$ transition-state anions depends on the nature of the entering and dis- placed groups. The susceptibility of sN2 and E2 transition states to transfer from protic to dipolar aprotic sol- vent depends very much on the type of carbon atom being attacked. Transition states for reaction of benzyl Hal > secondary RHal > primary RHal > CH3Hal > 4-nitrobenzyl Hal tend to be more solvated by methanol than by DMF in the order shown. Transition states for E2C and for sN2 reactions of similar substrates respond in much the same way to solvent transfer. Solvation of sN2 transition states varies by > 4 kcal mole-' according to the nature of the atom being attacked. “Solvation of substituents,” both in reactant and the transition state, influences rates of SNAr reactions. Protic-dipolar aprotic effects on rate usually are reflected in changes in enthalpy rather than in the entropy of activation. HMPT is the “fastest” solvent studied.},

abstract = {The impact of the chemical structure on ion transport, nanoscale morphology, and dynamics in polymerized imidazolium-based ionic liquids is investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and X-ray scattering, complemented with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Anion volume is found to correlate strongly with T g -independent ionic conductivities spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, a systematic increase in alkyl side chain length results in about one decade decrease in T g -independent ionic conductivity correlating with an increase in the characteristic back-bone-to-backbone distances found from scattering and simulations. The quantitative comparison between ion sizes, morphology, and ionic conductivity underscores the need for polymerized ionic liquids with small counterions and short alkyl side chain length in order to obtain polymer electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity. P olymerized ionic liquids (polyILs) combine the attractive mechanical characteristics of polymers with the unique physicochemical properties of low molecular weight ionic liquids (ILs). 1−15 These properties make polyILs appealing candidates for various applications, such as electrolytes in electrochemical devices including lithium ion batteries, super-capacitors, fuel cells, and dye-sensitized solar cells. 16−18 High ionic conductivity coupled with robust mechanical properties is one of the main requirements of electrolytes for these applications. As a consequence, concerted efforts have focused on establishing the link between the molecular structure, morphology, and ionic transport in polyILs, with the aim of developing new polymer electrolytes with high ionic con-ductivities. 19−29 One approach is to lower the glass transition temperatures (T g) through lower molecular weights or inclusion of flexible functional groups such as silanes. 21 Such polyILs usually have relatively high ionic conductivity but poor mechanical properties at ambient conditions. As high mechanical modulus is typically achieved below T g it is therefore of interest to develop strategies to increase ionic conductivity independent of T g . In a recent study, Salas de la Cruz et al. 30 probed the X-ray scattering profiles and ionic conductivity of poly(1-alkyl-3-vinylimidazolium)-based ionic liquids as a function of the alkyl chain length (and for two different counteranions). They concluded that three character-istic length scales (associated with backbone-to-backbone, ion-to-ion and pendant-to-pendant spacings) describe the nano-scale structure. They observed that the T g -independent ionic conductivity decreases by about 1 order of magnitude when the alkyl chain length is varied from ethyl to octyl and proposed a model relating the T g -independent ionic conductivity to backbone-to-backbone spacing. 30 In a related study, Evans et al. 31 investigated the influence of positioning the charged species either along the polyIL backbone or in pendant groups, and observed that " backbone " polyILs result in a nearly 10-fold increase in the T g -independent ionic conductivity. This presumably arises from differences in morphology accompany-ing the placement of the charged groups in the polymer backbone. 31 Although these studies highlight the impact of polymer morphology on ionic conduction, the resultant order of magnitude increase in the T g -independent ionic conductivity cannot adequately explain the experimentally observed disparity between molecular and polyILs. What other molecular parameters control the T g -independent ionic conductivity? In the current investigation, broadband dielectric spectros-copy and wide-angle X-ray scattering, along with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, are employed to probe the impact of molecular structure and nanoscale morphology on T g -independent ionic conductivity in a series of imidazolium},

We study intermolecular coupling at the air/water interface and find intermolecular coupling 1) to be significantly reduced and 2) to vary strongly for different water molecules at the interface-whereas in bulk water the coupling is homogeneous. For strongly hydrogen-bonded OH groups, coupling is roughly half of that of bulk water, due to the lower density in the near-surface region. For weakly hydrogen-bonded OH groups that absorb around 3500 cm(-1) , which are assigned to the outermost, yet hydrogen-bonded OH groups pointing towards the liquid, coupling is further reduced by an additional factor of 2. Remarkably, despite the reduced structural constraints imposed by the interfacial hydrogen-bond environment, the structural relaxation is slow and the intermolecular coupling of these water molecules is weak.},

This well-known effect has been attributed to hydrophobic headgroups creating ice-like or clathrate-like structures in the surrounding water, although experimental support for this hypothesis is scarce. In fact, an increasing amount of experimental and theoretical work suggests that the hydrophobic headgroups of alcohol molecules in aqueous solution cluster together. However, a consistent description of the details of this self-association is lacking. Here we use neutron diffraction with isotope substitution to probe the molecular-scale structure of a concentrated alcohol water mixture (7:3 molar ratio). Our data indicate that most of the water molecules exist as small hydrogen-bonded strings and clusters in a 'fluid' of close-packed methyl groups, with water clusters bridging neighbouring methanol hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding. This behaviour suggests that the anomalous thermodynamics of water alcohol systems arises from incomplete mixing at the molecular level and from retention of remnants of the three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network structure of bulk water.},

The MD simulations show the IL to be nanostructurally organized into an ionic network and nonpolar domains, with CH3CN molecules localized in the interfacial region between the ionic network and nonpolar domains, as found previously by other researchers. The MD simulations indicate strong interactions between CH3CN and the hydrogen atoms on the imidazolium ring of the cation. The low-frequency (0–200 cm−1) intermolecular part of the reduced spectral densities (RSDs) of the mixtures narrows and shifts to lower frequency as the concentration of CH3CN increases. These spectral changes can be partly attributed to the increasing contribution of the low-frequency intermolecular modes of CH3CN to the RSD. At a given composition, the RSD of a mixture is found to be broader and higher in frequency than the corresponding ideal RSD given by the volume-fraction-weighted sum of the RSDs of the neat liquids. This difference is rationalized in terms of the competition between CH3CN–cation interactions and solute-induced disruption of the ionic networks.},

The technique is verified on the model compound 1,3-cyclohexanedione and subsequently used to clarify the distribution of structures that the acetylproline-NH(2) dipeptide adopts in chloroform.

abstract = {The center line slope (CLS) method is often used to extract the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) from 2D IR spectra to delineate dynamics and to identify homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the absorption line shape of a system. While the CLS method is extremely efficient, quite accurate, and immune to many experimental artifacts, it has only been developed and properly applied to systems that have a single vibrational band, or to systems of two species that have spectrally resolved absorption bands. In many cases, the constituent spectra of multiple component systems overlap and cannot be distinguished from each other. This situation creates ambiguity when analyzing 2D IR spectra because dynamics for different species cannot be separated. Here a mathematical formulation is presented that extends the CLS method for a system consisting of two components (chemically distinct uncoupled oscillators). In a single component system, the CLS corresponds to the time-dependent portion of the normalized FFCF. This is not the case for a two component system, as a much more complicated expression arises. The CLS method yields a series of peak locations originating from slices taken through the 2D spectra. The slope through these peak locations yields the CLS value for the 2D spectra at a given T(w). We derive analytically that for two component systems, the peak location of the system can be decomposed into a weighted combination of the peak locations of the constituent spectra. The weighting depends upon the fractional contribution of each species at each wavelength and also on the vibrational lifetimes of both components. It is found that an unknown FFCF for one species can be determined as long as the peak locations (referred to as center line data) of one of the components are known, as well as the vibrational lifetimes, absorption spectra, and other spectral information for both components. This situation can arise when a second species is introduced into a well characterized single species system. An example is a system in which water exists in bulk form and also as water interacting with an interface. An algorithm is presented for back-calculating the unknown FFCF of the second component. The accuracy of the algorithm is tested with a variety of model cases in which all components are initially known. The algorithm successfully reproduces the FFCF for the second component within a reasonable degree of error.},

abstract = {We report the real-time measurement of the ultrafast reorientational motion of water molecules at the water-air interface, using femtosecond time- and polarization-resolved vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy. Vibrational excitation of dangling OH bonds along a specific polarization axis induces a transient anisotropy that decays due to the reorientation of vibrationally excited OH groups. The reorientation of interfacial water is shown to occur on subpicosecond time scales, several times faster than in the bulk, which can be attributed to the lower degree of hydrogen bond coordination at the interface. Molecular dynamics simulations of interfacial water dynamics are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations and show that, unlike in bulk, the interfacial reorientation occurs in a largely diffusive manner.},

abstract = {In a symmetric hydrogen bond (H-bond), the hydrogen atom is perfectly centered between the two donor atoms. The energy diagram for hydrogen motion is thus a single-well potential, rather than the double-well potential of a more typical H-bond, in which the hydrogen is covalently bonded to one atom and H-bonded to the other. Examples of symmetric H-bonds are often found in crystal structures, and they exhibit the distinctive feature of unusually short length: for example, the O-O distance in symmetric OHO H-bonds is found to be less than 2.5 {\AA}. In comparison, the O-O distance in a typical asymmetric H-bond, such as ROH{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}OR(2), ranges from about 2.7 to 3.0 {\AA}. In this Account, we briefly review and update our use of the method of isotopic perturbation to search for a symmetric, centered, or single-well-potential H-bond in solution. Such low-barrier H-bonds are thought to be unusually strong, owing perhaps to the resonance stabilization of two identical resonance forms [A-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}B ↔ A{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H-B]. This presumptive bond strength has been invoked to explain some enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Yet in solution, a wide variety of OHO, OHN, and NHN H-bonds have all been found to be asymmetric, in double-well potentials. Examples include the monoanion of (±)-2,3-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid and a protonated tetramethylnaphthalenediamine, even though these two ions are often considered prototypes of species with strong H-bonds. In fact, all of the purported examples of strong, symmetric H-bonds have been found to exist in solution as pairs of asymmetric tautomers, in contrast to their symmetry in some crystals. The asymmetry can be attributed to the disorder of the local solvation environment, which leads to an equilibrium among solvatomers (that is, isomers that differ in solvation). If the disorder of the local environment is sufficient to break symmetry, then symmetry itself is not sufficient to stabilize the H-bond, and symmetric H-bonds do not have an enhanced stability or an unusual strength. Nor are short H-bonds unusually strong. We discuss previous evidence for "short, strong, low-barrier" H-bonds and show it to be based on ambiguous comparisons. The role of such H-bonds in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is then ascribed not to any unusual strength of the H-bond itself but to relief of "strain."},

abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d<r(2)>dT(<r(2)> is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature T(K), and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

The DLS and SLS results reveal the formation of discrete spherical and non-interacting water droplets stabilized by the bmim-AOT surfactant. Moreover, since the droplet size increases as the W0 (W0 = [water]/[surfactant]) value increases, water interacts with the RM interface. From FT-IR and 1H NMR data, a weaker water–surfactant interaction in bmim-AOT RMs in comparison with the RMs created by sodium 1,4-bis-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate (Na-AOT) is detected. Consequently, there are less water molecules interacting with the interface in bmim-AOT RMs, and their hydrogen bond network is not completely disrupted as they are in Na-AOT RMs. The results show how the nature of the new cation impacts the interaction between the entrapped water and the RM interface, modifying the interfacial water structure in comparison with the results known for Na-AOT.},

abstract = {Frequency resolved pump-probe experiments have been conducted on the deuterated hydroxyl stretch of methanol-d in a solution containing 0.8% methanol-d/23%d/23% methanol-h in carbon tetrachloride. Methanol-d molecules that both donate and receive hydrogen bonds have an inhomogeneously broadened hydroxyl stretch absorption line centered at 2487 cm−1.2487 cm−1. With a laser tuned to 2513 cm−1,2513 cm−1, the high-frequency side of the absorption spectrum is excited. The equilibration of the excited state peak and the ground-state hole results in the time-dependent shift in the frequency of the signal, which is used to monitor the dynamics of spectral diffusion. Model calculations were conducted to address the influence of spectral diffusion in the ground and excited states on the experimental observables when the vibrational lifetime is comparable to the spectral diffusion time. The model calculations illustrate the influence on the signal of absorbers in the ground state that have relaxed from the excited state. This aspect of the problem has not been addressed in previous descriptions of frequency resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. The calculations were used to fit the time-dependent peak maximum, resulting in a bi-exponential frequency–frequency correlation function, with a fast time constant of roughly 0.1 ps and a slower time constant of 1.6±0.3 ps.1.6±0.3 ps. The observed dynamics have been compared with the predictions of dielectric continuum theory. The inability of a simple dielectric continuum theory to predict the observed spectral diffusion dynamics suggests that these dynamics do not result from the long-wavelength, collective orientational relaxation of the solvent. Instead the dynamics are attributed to fluctuations in the local hydrogen bond network, which is consistent with recent molecular-dynamics simulations of vibrational transient hole burning in water.},

abstract = {The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e.g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e.g. MnO(2), conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.},

abstract = {A strong nonresonant nanosecond laser pulse is used to align neutral iodine molecules. The technique, applicable to both polar and nonpolar molecules, relies on the interaction between the strong laser field and the induced dipole moment of the molecules. The degree of alignment is enhanced by lowering the initial rotational energy of the molecules or by increasing the laser intensity. The alignment is measured by photodissociating the molecules with a femtosecond laser pulse and detecting the direction of the photofragments by imaging techniques. The strongest degree of alignment observed is ͗cos 2 ␪͘ϭ0.81.},

abstract = {DNA covered materials are important in technological applications such as biosensors and microarrays, but obtaining structural information of surface bound biomolecules is experimentally challenging. In this paper, we structurally characterize single-stranded DNA monolayers of poly(thymine) from 10 to 25 bases in length with an emerging surface technique called two-dimensional sum frequency generation (2D SFG) spectroscopy. These experiments are carried out by adding a mid-IR pulse shaper to a femtosecond broadband SFG spectrometer. Cross peaks and 2D lineshapes in the 2D SFG spectra provide information about structure and dynamics. Because the 2D SFG spectra are heterodyne detected, the monolayer spectra can be directly compared to 2D Infrared (2D IR) spectra of poly(thymine) in solution, which aids interpretation. We simulate the 2D SFG spectra using DFT calculations and an excitonic Hamiltonian that relates the molecular geometry to the vibrational coupling. Intra-base cross peaks help define the orientation of the bases and inter-base cross peaks, created by coupling between bases, resolves features not observed in linear SFG spectra that constrain the relative geometries of stacked bases. We present a structure for the poly(T) oligomer that is consistent with the 2D SFG data. These experiments provide insight into the DNA monolayer structure and set precedent for studying complex biomolecules on surfaces with 2D SFG spectroscopy.},

The effect of the length of alkylic chains in cations was studied with mixtures (mixture 2) of [b3mpy][BF(4)] and [o3mpy][BF(4)] ionic liquids, also studied in the full composition range, leading to [b3mpy](x)[o3mpy](1-x)[BF(4)] ionic liquids. Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflection spectra were recorded and analyzed as a function of anionic and cationic composition for the two studied mixture types. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were also performed for mixtures 1 and 2 as a function of anionic and cationic composition. The reported experimental and computational results show that the properties of the studied mixed systems change in an almost linear way, leading to almost ideal mixtures from the thermodynamic viewpoint, and thus pointing to simple dilution effects of the involved ions controlling the mixture properties.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs), molten salts that are liquid at room temperature, are considered as a potential green replacement for toxic volatile organic compounds in many applications. These liquids exhibit unique properties such as negligible vapor pressure, nonflammability, wide liquid range, high thermal and chemical stabilities, and high solvating capacities for inorganic, organic, and polymeric compounds. In this paper, computer-aided molecular design of potential ILs for cellulose dissolution was performed. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was first developed to predict cellulose solubility in ILs using the group contribution (GC) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem was then formulated with an objective function that maximizes the QSAR model. The solution to the MINLP problem given by genetic algorithm (GA) corresponded to the optimal ILs structure for cellulose dissolution. For example, the cellulose solubility in ILs developed in the present work was at least 1.2 times experimentally higher than that of the best ILs reported for cellulose dissolution. In addition, the addition of cellulose compatible organic cosolvent such as DMSO could enhance the cellulose solubility up to 4 times as compared to that of conventional ILs/cosolvent system. Moreover, the similar degree of polymerization of regenerated and native celluloses indicated that the developed ILs in this study were nonderivatizing solvents for cellulose dissolution. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Transient two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy is used as a probe of protein unfolding dynamics in a direct comparison of fast unfolding experiments with molecular dynamics simulations. In the experiments, the unfolding of ubiquitin is initiated by a laser temperature jump, and protein structural evolution from nanoseconds to milliseconds is probed using amide I 2D IR spectroscopy. The temperature jump prepares a subensemble near the unfolding transition state, leading to quasi-barrierless unfolding (the “burst phase”) before the millisecond activated unfolding kinetics. The burst phase unfolding of ubiquitin is characterized by a loss of the coupling between vibrations of the $\beta$-sheet, a process that manifests itself in the 2D IR spectrum as a frequency blue-shift and intensity decrease of the diagonal and cross-peaks of the sheet's two IR active modes. As the sheet unfolds, increased fluctuations and solvent exposure of the $\beta$-sheet amide groups are also characterized by increases in homogeneous linewidth. Experimental spectra are compared with 2D IR spectra calculated from the time-evolving structures in a molecular dynamics simulation of ubiquitin unfolding. Unfolding is described as a sequential unfolding of strands in ubiquitin's $\beta$-sheet, using two collective coordinates of the sheet: (i) the native interstrand contacts between adjacent $\beta$-strands I and II and (ii) the remaining $\beta$-strand contacts within the sheet. The methods used illustrate the general principles by which 2D IR spectroscopy can be used for detailed dynamical comparisons of experiment and simulation.},

abstract = {It is often asserted that deviation from the Nernst-Einstein relation (NE) between the molar conductivity (Lambda) and ion self-diffusion coefficients (D(i)) in ionic liquids (ILs) and molten salts is evidence for ion pairing. The NE was originally derived for noninteracting ions, as in an infinitely dilute electrolyte solution. In reality, mass, charge, momentum, and energy transport processes in ILs and molten salts involve correlated interionic collisions, caging, and vortex motions, as in any other dense liquid. Phenomenological theory using nonequilibrium thermodynamics and literature molecular dynamics simulations shows that deviations from the simple NE expression occur due to differences in cross-correlations of ionic velocities. ILs have also been shown, like molecular liquids generally, and model fluids such as the Lennard-Jones, to fit the fractional form of the Stokes-Einstein relation, D(i)/T proportional to (1/eta)(t) and Lambda proportional to (1/eta)(t), where eta is the shear viscosity. Here, it is shown that when this is the case, the NE deviation parameter Delta is then a constant, independent of temperature and pressure (consistent with experiment) and the value of the parameter t; it is a function of the ionic charges and volumes, but not the masses. Therefore, Delta is not a measure of "ionicity": it is necessary to seek other independent evidence to determine whether ion pairing is present in a given ionic liquid or molten salt. The use of "apparent" transport numbers derived from self-diffusion coefficients to describe charge transport in pure salts is argued to be unnecessary.},

We found that the carboxyl group adopts two distinct configurations: a configuration in which the carbonyl group is oriented antiparallel to the hydroxyl (anti-conformer), and a configuration in which the carbonyl group is oriented at an angle of ∼60° with respect to the hydroxyl (syn-conformer). These results constitute the first experimental evidence that carboxyl groups exist as two distinct and long-living conformational isomers in aqueous solution at room temperature. T he chemical impact of conformational isomerism has been recognized for a long time. 1−6 The conformation change of a relatively small molecular group can have a large impact on the macromolecular structure. For example, the cis/ trans-isomerization of the amino acid proline determines the conformation of the folded protein. 7−11 Carboxyl groups play an important role in this respect as they form strong inter-and intramolecular hydrogen bonds that govern and stabilize macromolecular structures. 12,13 As a consequence, the conformational isomerism of carboxylic acids has been intensely studied with different calculation techniques. 14−17 These studies predicted the existence of distinct conforma-tional isomers of the carboxyl group in the gas phase and in aqueous solution. Up to now, distinct carboxyl group conformers have only been experimentally observed in rare-gas matrices under cryogenic conditions. 18−20 Under these conditions, the chemical reactivity of the carboxyl group was also observed to depend on its conformation. 21 The carboxyl group adopts two distinct planar geometries in rare gas matrices at low temperatures, as illustrated in Figure 1. 18,19,22−24 In the syn-conformer the O−H group is oriented at ∼60° with respect to the CO and in the anti-conformer the O−H is antiparallel to the CO. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the high energy anti-conformer stabilizes under hydration, and that its equilibrium concentration in gas phase is negligible. 16,17,25 The anti-and syn-configurations were identified with linear infrared spectroscopy, which was enabled by the fact that the carbonyl and hydroxyl stretch vibrations of the carboxyl group have narrow absorption lines when the group is immersed in a rare-gas matrix at an extremely low temperature. In room-temperature solutions, in particular, in water, the carbonyl and hydroxyl stretch vibrations are strongly affected by the interactions with the surrounding solvent molecules, leading to a strong broadening of the absorption bands. In addition, at acid concentrations above ∼3 M, the vibrations will also be affected by dimer formation. 26−28 These effects preclude the study of conformational isomerism of carboxylic acids in aqueous media at room temperature with conventional linear infrared spectroscopy. Here we use two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy to study the conformations of carboxyl group of formic acid molecules in room temperature solutions. We study the coupling between the carbonyl (CO) and hydroxyl (O−D) stretch vibrations for deuterated formic acid dissolved in different solvents, including water. We found that the measurement of this coupling reveals the relative orientation of the carbonyl and the hydroxyl groups, and thus forms a unique experimental test of the existence of conformational isomerism of carboxylic acids under biorelevant conditions. In Figure 2a and b we show the linear infrared spectra of formic acid dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile and heavy Figure 1. Schematic picture of syn-and anti-conformers.

abstract = {Experimental and molecular modeling studies are conducted to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the high solubility of CO2 in imidazolium-based ionic liquids. CO2 absorption isotherms at 10, 25, and 50 degrees C are reported for six different ionic liquids formed by pairing three different anions with two cations that differ only in the nature of the "acidic" site at the 2-position on the imidazolium ring. Molecular dynamics simulations of these two cations paired with hexafluorophosphate in the pure state and mixed with CO2 are also described. Both the experimental and the simulation results indicate that the anion has the greatest impact on the solubility of CO2. Experimentally, it is found that the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion has the greatest affinity for CO2, while there is little difference in CO2 solubility between ionic liquids having the tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate anion. The simulations show strong organization of CO2 about hexafluorophosphate anions, but only small differences in CO2 structure about the different cations. This is consistent with the experimental finding that, for a given anion, there are only small differences in CO2 solubility for the two cations. Computed and measured densities, partial molar volumes, and thermal expansion coefficients are also reported.},

abstract = {The tumor microenvironment, or stroma, is chemically and morphologically modified during carcinoma progression. The predominant cell type in the stroma, the fibroblast, maintains collagen properties in normal tissue and often transformed during tumor progression. Biochemical changes within fibroblasts upon initial cancer activation, however, are relatively poorly defined. Here, we hypothesized that Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging could potentially be employed to examine these early transformations. Further, we employ attenuated total reflectance (ATR) microscopy to characterize subcellular spectra and their changes upon transformation. We characterized fibroblast transitions upon stimulation with both a molecular agent and a carcinoma-mimicking cellular co-culture system. Changes were predominantly observed in the 1080 cm(−1) and 1224 cm(−1) peak absorbance, commonly associated with nucleic acids, as well as in the band at 2930 cm(−1) associated with the C-H stretching of proteins in the cytoplasmic compartment. In conclusion, biochemical changes in cancer-associated fibroblasts that express a-SMA are dominated by the cytoplasm, rather than the nucleus. This ensures that spectral changes are not associated with proliferation or cell cycle processes of the cells and the cells are undergoing a true phenotypic change denoted by protein modifications in the cell body. },

abstract = {Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and time-resolved IR spectroscopies have been used to study vibrational band positions, vibrational energy relaxation (VER) rates, and reorientation times of anions in several ionic liquid (IL) solutions. The ILs primarily investigated are based on the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium ([BM2IM]) cation with thiocyanate (NCS-), dicyanamide (N(CN)(2)(-)), and tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) anions. Spectroscopic studies are carried out near 2000 cm(-1) for the C\&3bond; N stretching bands of NCS- and N(CN)(2)(-) as the IL anion as well as for NCS-, N(CN)(2)(-), and azide (N-3(-)) anions dissolved in [BM2IM][BF4]. The VER studies of N(CN)(2)(-) are reported for the first time. VER of N-3(-), NCS-, and N(CN)(2)(-) is measured in normal solvents, such as N-methylformamide, to compare with the IL solutions. The spectral shifts and VER rates of the anions in IL solution are quite similar to those in polar aprotic, conventional organic solvents, i.e., dimethylsulfoxide, and significantly different than those in methanol, in which there is hydrogen bonding. Similar studies were also carried out for the anions in another IL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]), in which the C2 hydrogen is present. The results for the anions are similar to those in the [BM2IM] containing ILs, in which the C2 hydrogen is methyl substituted. This suggests that substituting this hydrogen has, at most, a minor effect on the degree of hydrogen bonding in the anion-IL solvation interaction based on the infrared spectra and dynamics.

abstract = {With the continued development of pulsed x‐ray sources, it may in time be possible to use transient x‐ray diffraction to follow the molecular dynamics of chemical reactions in the liquid and solid states. To explore this possibility from the theoretical side, we have calculated, using classical molecular dynamics, the picosecond time‐resolved x‐ray scattering of a simplified model for a liquid state chemical reaction of substantial interest: the photodissociation of I2 molecules in rare gas and hexane solvents. The time scale of the separation of the I atoms and the effect of the solvent on their motion are observed in the computed transient x‐ray diffraction patterns, and such effects might also be observed in a suitably designed experiment. This illustrates that transient x‐ray diffraction might be an experimental tool for discovering the molecular dynamics of chemical reactions, with the advantage over transient optical spectroscopies such as infrared, electronic, and Raman that the connections between dynamics and diffraction can be precisely computed without uncertainties due to imprecise knowledge of dipole moments, transition dipole moments, and polarizabilities.},

The electrodeposition of Co2+ in EAN occurs at ?0.95 V vs. Fc0/+, followed by hydrogen evolution reaction. The electro-oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ is found to be a reversible process in dried EAN at E1/2 ¼ 1.47 V vs. Fc0/+. The presence of water significantly affects the voltammetric behaviour of Co2+ and the subsequent electrodeposition processes. Cobalt oxides nanostructures have been deposited onto glassy carbon and indium tin oxide (ITO)- coated glass substrates by two routes, (i) controlled-potential deposition of Co, followed by spontaneous air oxidation and (ii) controlled-potential deposition of Co followed by anodic oxidation in the presence of water. SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS reveal that cobalt oxides of different morphologies and chemical compositions are formed on the surface of electrodes.

Among many approaches for obtaining such materials, solution-processable MOPs derived from rigid and contorted macromolecular structures are promising because of their excellent mass transport and mass exchange capability. Here we show a class of amorphous MOP, prepared by [2+3] cycloaddition modification of a polymer containing an aromatic nitrile group with an azide compound, showing super-permeable characteristics and outstanding CO(2) separation performance, even under polymer plasticization conditions such as CO(2)/light gas mixtures. This unprecedented result arises from the introduction of tetrazole groups into highly microporous polymeric frameworks, leading to more favourable CO(2) sorption with superior affinity in gas mixtures, and selective CO(2) transport by presorbed CO(2) molecules that limit access by other light gas molecules. This strategy provides a direction in the design of MOP membrane materials for economic CO(2) capture processes.},

abstract = {Transient thermal unfolding of ubiquitin is investigated using nonlinear infrared spectroscopy after a nanosecond laser temperature jump (T-jump). The abrupt change in the unfolding free energy surface and the ns time resolution allow us to observe a fast response on ns to $\mu$s time-scales, which we attribute to downhill unfolding, before a cross-over to ms kinetics. The downhill unfolding by a sub-population of folded proteins is induced through a shift of the barrier toward the native state. By adjusting the T-jump width, the effect of the initial (Ti) and final (Tf) temperature on the unfolding dynamics can be separated. From the amplitude of the fast downhill unfolding, the fractional population prepared at the unfolding transition state is obtained. This population increases with both Ti and with Tf. A two-state kinetic analysis of the ms refolding provides thermodynamic information about the barrier height. By a combination of the fast and slow unfolding and folding parameters, a quasi-two-state kinetic analysis is performed to calculate the time-dependent population changes of the folded state. This calculation coincides with the experimentally obtained population changes at low temperature but deviations are found in the T-jump from 67 to 78°C. Using temperature-dependent barrier height changes, a temperature $\Phi$ value analysis is performed. The result shows a decreasing trend of $\Phi$T with temperature, which indicates an increase of the heterogeneity of the transition state. We conclude that ubiquitin unfolds along a well-defined pathway at low temperature which expands with increasing temperature to include multiple routes.},

annote = {Isolated Ca2+-binding EF-hand peptides have a tendency to dimerize. This study is an attempt to account for the coupled equilibria of Ca2+-binding and peptide association for two EF-hands with strikingly different loop sequence and net charge. We have studied each of the two separate EF-hand fragments from calbindin D9k. A series of Ca2+-titrations at different peptide concentrations were monitored by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. All data were fitted simultaneously to both a complete model of all possible equilibrium intermediates and a reduced model not including dimerization in the absence of Ca2+. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that the peptides may occur as monomers or dimers depending on the solution conditions. Our results show strikingly different behavior for the two EF-hands. The fragment containing the N-terminal EF-hand shows a strong tendency to dimerize in the Ca2+-bound state. The average Ca2+-affinity is 3.5 orders of magnitude lower than for the intact protein. We observe a large apparent cooperativity of Ca2+ binding for the overall process from Ca2+-free monomer to fully loaded dimer, showing that a Ca2+-free EF-hand folds upon dimerization to a Ca2+-bound EF-hand, thereby presenting a preformed binding site to the second Ca2+-ion. The C-terminal EF-hand shows a much smaller tendency to dimerize, which may be related to its larger net negative charge. In spite of the differences in dimerization behavior, the Ca2+ affinities of both EF-hand fragments are similar and in the range lgK = 4.6-5.3. {\copyright}2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To date, only metals are known to exhibit surface plasmon resonance and only noble metals have practical application. According to theory SPR should be observable in any conductor. This theoretical prediction is verified in the present study. The compositions of many conducting metal oxides are systematically variable, suggesting a significant advance in thin film characterization and innovative possibilities for versatile and sensitive chemical sensing applications.},

abstract = {Aqueous nitrate, NO3(-)(aq), was studied by 2D-IR, UV-IR, and UV-UV time-resolved spectroscopies in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the purpose of determining the hydration dynamics around the anion. In water, the D3h symmetry of NO3(-) is broken, and the degeneracy of the asymmetric-stretch modes is lifted. This provides a very sensitive probe of the ion-water interactions. The 2D-IR measurements reveal excitation exchange between the two nondegenerate asymmetric-stretch vibrations on a 300-fs time scale concomitant with fast anisotropy decay of the diagonal-peak signals. The MD simulations show that this is caused by jumps of the transition dipole orientations related to fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds connecting the nitrate ion to the nearest water molecules. Reorientation of the ion, which is associated with the hydrogen-bond breaking, was monitored by time-resolved UV-IR and UV-UV spectroscopy, revealing a 2-ps time constant. These time scales are very similar to those reported for isotope-labeled water, suggesting that NO3(-)(aq) has a labile hydration shell.},

Image guided and targeted minimally invasive therapy has the promise to improve outcome and reduce collateral effects. Early detection of cancer through screening based on imaging is probably the major contributor to a reduction in mortality for certain cancers. Targeted imaging of receptors, gene therapy expression and cancer stem cells are research activities that will translate into clinical use in the next decade.

Electrochemical processes form an important subset of these that are particularly of interest, since ILs tend to be good electrochemical solvents and exhibit other properties which make them very useful as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. It is important therefore to understand the extent to which electrochemical reactions and processes behave in a relatively ‘‘normal'', for example aqueous solution, fashion as opposed to exhibiting phenomena more uniquely the product of their organic ionic nature. This perspective examines a range of electrochemical reactions in ionic liquids, in many cases in the context of real world applications, to highlight the phenomena as far as they are understood and where data gaps exist. The important areas of lithium and conducting polymer electrochemistry are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Icy aerosol particles determine weather processes in planetary atmospheres and are discussed as sites of chemical reactions in interstellar dust. One of the interesting ice systems in this context are pure and composite SO2 particles. Vibrational exciton coupling is exploited in the present study to understand the properties of SO2 aerosol particles from their infrared spectroscopic signatures. The condensation to pure SO2 ice particles leads to a partially amorphous structure of the particles, whose infrared spectra do not show pronounced shape effects. The simultaneous condensation of SO2 and CO2 gas results in aerosol particles with a core-shell structure. Icy SO2 forms the core, whereas CO2 remains in the shell. This structure is mainly determined by the different thermodynamic properties of the two substances and the less favorable intermolecular interactions between SO2 and CO2 compared with the pure substances. The example of mixed sulfur dioxide/ammonia particles demonstrates that nanosized aerosol particles are ideal nanoreactors. They facilitate an easy homogeneous mixture of the reactants providing an interface-free reaction environment.},

abstract = {The phase separation behavior of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4 ]) was investigated by rheological, optical microscopy, FT-IR and DSC measurements. It is demonstrated that specific interactions, particularly the hydrogen bonding between PEO and the ionic liquids as evidenced by FT-IR, in which a subtle but apparent absorption peak shift near the phase transition appears, account for the unusual low critical solution temperature (LCST) phase separation. Unlike the typical trend in which the storage modulus G 0 simply increases with temperature near the phase boundary for polymer blends without specific interaction, in our study, a novel ''V-shaped'' rheological response is observed, namely a dip in G 0 followed by an upturn, especially at low PEO concentration (o50 wt%). The magnitude of the ''V'' dip has heating rate and frequency dependences, while T r (the phase transition temperature) is almost unchanged with heating rate and frequency. Upon increasing the alkyl chain length on the imidazolium ring from an ethyl to a butyl, the ''V-shape'' becomes more prominent and shifts to higher temperature, which is consistent with the results of FT-IR and DSC, evidently due to the stronger hydrogen bonding interaction between PEO and [BMIM][BF 4 ] than [EMIM][BF 4 ]. This unusual ''V'' dip might be tentatively ascribed to the coupling effects of the breaking of the ''hydrogen bonding cage'' formed between PEO chains and IL molecules and dissolution of the heterogeneous clusters as verified by FT-IR and TEM, respectively, and the following upturn is dominated by the interface formation upon phase separation.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bond dynamics of water in highly concentrated NaBr salt solutions and reverse micelles are studied using ultrafast 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy and polarization-selective IR pump-probe experiments performed on the OD hydroxyl stretch of dilute HOD in H2O. The vibrational echo experiments measure spectral diffusion, and the pump-probe experiments measure orientational relaxation. Both experimental observables are directly related to the structural dynamics of water's hydrogen bond network. The measurements performed on NaBr solutions as a function of concentration show that the hydrogen bond dynamics slow as the NaBr concentration increases. The most pronounced change is in the longest time scale dynamics which are related to the global rearrangement of the hydrogen bond structure. Complete hydrogen bond network randomization slows by a factor of similar to 3 in similar to 6 M NaBr solution compared to that in bulk water. The hydrogen bond dynamics of water in nanoscopically confined environments are studied by encapsulating water molecules in ionic head group (AOT) and nonionic head group (Igepal CO 520) reverse micelles. Water dynamics in the nanopools of AOT reverse micelles are studied as a function of size by observing orientational relaxation. Orientational relaxation dynamics deviate significantly from bulk water when the size of the reverse micelles is smaller than several nm and become nonexponential and slower as the size of the reverse micelles decreases. In the smallest reverse micelles, orientational relaxation (hydrogen bond structural randomization) is almost 20 times slower than that in bulk water. To determine if the changes in dynamics from bulk water are caused by the influence of the ionic head groups of AOT or the nanoconfinement, the water dynamics in 4 nm nanopools in AOT reverse micelles (ionic) and Igepal reverse micelles (nonionic) are compared. It is found that the water orientational relaxation in the 4 nm diameter nanopools of the two types of reverse micelles is almost identical, which indicates that confinement by an interface to form a nanoscopic water pool is a primary factor governing the dynamics of nanoscopic water rather than the presence of charged groups at the interface.},

W-Z has four acidic residues in chelating positions, two of which form a native Z-acid pair. We then generated seven additional N-terminal CaM mutants to examine the role of chelating acidic residues in Mg 2+ binding and exchange with the first EF-hand of CaM. A CAM mutant with acidic residues in all of the chelating positions exhibited Mg 2+ affinity similar to that of W-Z. Only CaM mutants that had a Z-acid pair were able to bind Mg 2+ with physiologically relevant affinities. Removal of the Z-acid pair from the first EF-hand produced a dramatic 58-fold decrease in its Mg 2+ affinity. Additionally, removal of the Z-acid pair led to a 1.8-fold increase in the rate of Mg 2+ dissociation. Addition of an X- or Y-acid pair could not restore the high Mg 2+ binding lost with removal of the Z-acid pair. Therefore, the Z-acid pair in the first EF-hand of CaM supports high Mg 2+ binding primarily by increasing the rate of Mg 2+ association.},

abstract = {In a recently reported study [Mukherjee, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006, 103, 3528], we used 2D IR spectroscopy and 1-Cd-13=O-18 isotope labeling to measure the vibrational dynamics of 11 amide I modes in the CD3 zeta transmembrane domain. We found that the homogeneous line widths and population relaxation times were all nearly identical, but that the amount of inhomogeneous broadening correlated with the position of the amide group inside the membrane. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and dynamical origins of these experimental observations. We use two models to convert the simulations to frequency trajectories from which the mean frequencies, standard deviations, frequency correlation functions, and 2D IR spectra are calculated. Model 1 correlates the hydrogen-bond length to the amide I frequency, whereas model 2 uses an ab initio-based electrostatic model. We find that the structural distributions of the peptidic groups and their environment are reflected in the vibrational dynamics of the amide I modes. Environmental forces from the water and lipid headgroups partially denature the helices, shifting the infrared frequencies and creating larger inhomogeneous distributions for residues near the ends. The least inhomogeneously broadened residues are those located in the middle of the membrane where environmental electrostatic forces are weakest and the helices are most ordered. Comparison of the simulations to experiment confirms that the amide I modes near the C-terminal are larger than at the N-terminal because of the asymmetric structure of the peptide bundle in the membrane. The comparison also reveals that residues at a kink in the R-helices have broader line widths than more helical parts of the peptide because the peptide backbone at the kink exhibits a larger amount of structural disorder. Taken together, the simulations and experiments reveal that infrared line shapes are sensitive probes of membrane protein structural and environmental heterogeneity.},

Each S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer contains four EF-hand domains and two transition-metal-binding sites. We investigate the effect of Ca(II) ions on the structure and Ni(II)-binding properties of human CP. By employing energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we evaluate the metal content of Ni(II)-bound CP-Ser [oligomer of S100A8(C42S) and S100A9(C3S)] crystals obtained in the absence and presence of Ca(II). We present a 2.1 {\AA} resolution crystal structure of Ni(II)-bound CP-Ser and compare this structure to a reported Ni(II)- and Ca(II)-bound CP-Ser structure [Nakashige, T. G., et al. (2017) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 139, 8828-8836]. This analysis reveals conformational changes associated with coordination of Ca(II) to the EF-hands of S100A9 and that Ca(II) binding affects the coordination number and geometry of the Ni(II) ion bound to the His Asp site. In contrast, negligible differences are observed for the Ni(II)-His site in the absence and presence of Ca(II). Biochemical studies show that, whereas the His site has a thermodynamic preference for Ni(II) over Zn(II), the His Asp site selects for Zn(II) over Ni(II), and relatively rapid metal exchange occurs at this site. These observations inform the working model for how CP withholds nutrient metals in the extracellular space.},

abstract = {Metal-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity, with an emphasis on the generation and role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is reviewed. Metal-mediated formation of free radicals causes various modifications to DNA bases, enhanced lipid peroxidation, and altered calcium and sulfhydryl homeostasis. Lipid peroxides, formed by the attack of radicals on polyunsaturated fatty acid residues of phospholipids, can further react with redox metals finally producing mutagenic and carcinogenic malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal and other exocyclic DNA adducts (etheno and/or propano adducts). Whilst iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and cobalt (Co) undergo redox-cycling reactions, for a second group of metals, mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni), the primary route for their toxicity is depletion of glutathione and bonding to sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Arsenic (As) is thought to bind directly to critical thiols, however, other mechanisms, involving formation of hydrogen peroxide under physiological conditions, have been proposed. The unifying factor in determining toxicity and carcinogenicity for all these metals is the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Common mechanisms involving the Fenton reaction, generation of the superoxide radical and the hydroxyl radical appear to be involved for iron, copper, chromium, vanadium and cobalt primarily associated with mitochondria, microsomes and peroxisomes. However, a recent discovery that the upper limit of "free pools" of copper is far less than a single atom per cell casts serious doubt on the in vivo role of copper in Fenton-like generation of free radicals. Nitric oxide (NO) seems to be involved in arsenite-induced DNA damage and pyrimidine excision inhibition. Various studies have confirmed that metals activate signalling pathways and the carcinogenic effect of metals has been related to activation of mainly redox-sensitive transcription factors, involving NF-kappaB, AP-1 and p53. Antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic) provide protection against deleterious metal-mediated free radical attacks. Vitamin E and melatonin can prevent the majority of metal-mediated (iron, copper, cadmium) damage both in vitro systems and in metal-loaded animals. Toxicity studies involving chromium have shown that the protective effect of vitamin E against lipid peroxidation may be associated rather with the level of non-enzymatic antioxidants than the activity of enzymatic antioxidants. However, a very recent epidemiological study has shown that a daily intake of vitamin E of more than 400 IU increases the risk of death and should be avoided. While previous studies have proposed a deleterious pro-oxidant effect of vitamin C (ascorbate) in the presence of iron (or copper), recent results have shown that even in the presence of redox-active iron (or copper) and hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate acts as an antioxidant that prevents lipid peroxidation and does not promote protein oxidation in humans in vitro. Experimental results have also shown a link between vanadium and oxidative stress in the etiology of diabetes. The impact of zinc (Zn) on the immune system, the ability of zinc to act as an antioxidant in order to reduce oxidative stress and the neuroprotective and neurodegenerative role of zinc (and copper) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is also discussed. This review summarizes recent findings in the metal-induced formation of free radicals and the role of oxidative stress in the carcinogenicity and toxicity of metals.},

abstract = {Thermodynamics of 18-crown-6 complexes with ammonium cations (NH4, MeNH3, Me2NH2, Me3NH, Me4N, Et4N, phNH(3), and PhCH2NH3) in methanol were determined by titration calorimetry. The results show strong contributions from entropy terms counteracting the enthalpy of complexation, and a linear decrease of the complexation free energy Delta G with the number of available N-H hydrogen bonds, In several cases formation of relatively strong complexes containing two ammonium ions per crown unit was observed. Tetramethylammonium ions show no detectable association with the crown ether, demonstrating the absence of significant Coulomb-type interaction between the partial charges at the crown ether oxygen and the N+-C-H atoms. Ammonium ions bind to aza crown ethers with almost equal affinity as to the all-oxygen anologs only, if methyl groups at the nitrogen atoms force the lone pairs into equatorial position. Molecular mechanics calculations (CHARMm) of corresponding gas-phase complexes yield geometries and energies in agreement with this, with energetically equally good conformations of an essentially undistorted D-3d crown accepting either 3 Linear hydrogen bonds, or 6 bifurcated bonds from the primary ammonium cations. Complexation equilibria were measured with PhNH3, and PhCH2NH3 in water, 2-propanol, tert-butyl alcohol, n-octanol, DMF, DMSO, pyridine, HMPT and acetone mostly ay calorimetry, in some cases by potentiometry. The observed association constants varied by factors of up to 1000; the solvent effects can be described generally as a Linear function of the hydrogen bond accepting power of the solvent molecules, in line with the mechanisms derived above. The 1gK and Delta H values of the complexation of the PhNH3 or PHCH2NH3 cation with 18-crown-6 ligand are compared with a large range of available solvent properties. The best correlations (R approximate to 0.9) for 1gK (or Delta G) are obtained with values characterizing the electron donor capacity of the solvent (C-a, beta*, DN) for 1gK, as found earlier for complexes between K+ and 18C6.},

annote = {The ubiquitous Ca2+-regulatory protein calmodulin activates target enzymes as a response to submicromolar Ca2+ increases in a background of millimolar Mg2+. The potential influence of Mg2+/Ca2+ competition is especially intriguing for the N-terminal domain of the protein which possesses the sites with the lowest Ca2+ specificity. The interdependence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding in the N-terminal domain of calmodulin was therefore studied using 43Ca NMR, 1H-15N NMR, and fluorescent Ca2+ chelator techniques. The apparent affinity for Ca2+ was found to be significantly decreased at physiological Mg2+ levels. At Ca2+ concentrations of an activated cell the (Ca2+)2 state of the N-terminal domain is therefore only weakly populated, indicating that for this domain Ca2+ binding is intimately associated with binding of target molecules. The data are in good agreement with a two-site model in which each site can bind either Ca2+ or Mg2+. The Mg2+-Ca2+ binding interaction is slightly positively allosteric, resulting in a significantly populated (Mg2+)1(Ca2+)1 state. The Ca2+ off-rate from this state is determined to be at least one order of magnitude faster than from the (Ca2+)2 state. These two findings indicate that the (Mg2+)1(Ca2+)1 state is structurally and/or dynamically different from the (Ca2+)2 state. The 43Ca quadrupolar coupling constant and the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the (Mg2+)1(Ca2+)1 state were calculated from titration data. The values of both parameters suggest that the (Mg2+)1(Ca2+)1 state has a conformation more similar to the \&#039;closed\&#039; apo and (Mg2+)2 states than to the \&#039;open\&#039; (Ca2+)2 state.},

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) along with freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FF-TEM) measurements revealed that the sizes of single microemulsion droplets increased with increasing temperature. However, a decreased temperature led to the appearance of droplet clusters, which have also been observed previously when the single microemulsion droplets were swollen by added bmimBF4 to a certain extent (Gao, Y. A.; Vogit, A.; Hilfert, L.; Sundmacher, K. ChemPhysChem, 2008, 9, 1603-1609). Compared to traditional aqueous microemulsions, IL microemulsions revealed relatively high temperature-independence. The droplet-shaped microstructure was always kept in a large range of temperature. The temperature-independence is ascribed to the temperature-insensitive electrostatic attraction between the solubilized bmimBF4 and Triton X-100, which was considered to be the driving force for solubilizing bmimBF4 into the cores of Triton X-100 aggregates. Two-dimensional rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments (ROESY) further confirmed the microstructural change with temperature.},

The system relies on an ionic liquid electrolyte to lower the energy of the (CO(2))(-) intermediate, most likely by complexation, and thereby lower the initial reduction barrier. The silver cathode then catalyzes formation of the final products. Formation of gaseous CO is first observed at an applied voltage of 1.5 volts, just slightly above the minimum (i.e., equilibrium) voltage of 1.33 volts. The system continued producing CO for at least 7 hours at Faradaic efficiencies greater than 96%.},

Both monomeric and polymeric complexes have been investigated in these solvents. The anhydrous, nominally aprotic nature of these ionic liquids precludes the solvation and solvolysis phenomena that often corrupt these species in molecular solvents like water and acetonitrile. As a result, these ionic liquids stabilize a number of species that ordinarily exhibit only transient existence in most molecular solvents at room temperature. In addition, the recent finding that phosgene can be used both to remove adventitious oxide impurities from neat ionic liquids and to effect the in situ conversion of transition metal oxide halide complexes to halide complexes opens new pathways for investigating the solution chemistry of the former species.},

abstract = {The short-time orientational relaxation of water is studied by ultrafast infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the hydroxyl stretching mode (OD of dilute HOD in H2O). The anisotropy decay displays a sharp drop at very short times caused by inertial orientational motion, followed by a much slower decay that fully randomizes the orientation. Investigation of temperatures from 1 degrees C to 65 degrees C shows that the amplitude of the inertial component (extent of inertial angular displacement) depends strongly on the stretching frequency of the OD oscillator at higher temperatures, although the slow component is frequency-independent. The inertial component becomes frequency-independent at low temperatures. At high temperatures there is a correlation between the amplitude of the inertial decay and the strength of the O-D-O hydrogen bond, but at low temperatures the correlation disappears, showing that a single hydrogen bond (OD-O) is no longer a significant determinant of the inertial angular motion. It is suggested that the loss of correlation at lower temperatures is caused by the increased importance of collective effects of the extended hydrogen bonding network. By using a new harmonic cone model, the experimentally measured amplitudes of the inertial decays yield estimates of the characteristic frequencies of the intermolecular angular potential for various strengths of hydrogen bonds. The frequencies are in the range of approximate to 400 cm(-1). A comparison with recent molecular dynamics simulations employing the simple point charge-extended water model at room temperature shows that the simulations qualitatively reflect the correlation between the inertial decay and the OD stretching frequency.},

A Trotter type of approximation is used for the matrix exponent that describes the time evolution of the quantum system. This is needed for calculating the third-order response functions governing the two-dimensional infrared and visible spectra. The method is tested on a model dimer system, the amide I spectrum of the Gramicidin A antimicrobial peptide, the spectrum of the OH stretching vibration of bulk water, and a homogeneous J-aggregate. Errors due to the approximation are hardly observable in the calculated spectra. Scaling simulations with different system sizes are used to demonstrate that the new scheme is indeed scaling with the system size to the third power, one order faster than the existing methods.},

The binding groove opens on a 100-ns timescale in a highly nonexponential manner, and the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the process is governed by the rearrangement of the water network on the protein surface. We propose this rearrangement of the water network to be another possible mechanism of allostery.},

abstract = {The transition states of a chemical reaction in solution are generally accessed through exchange of thermal energy between the solvent and the reactants. As such, an ensemble of reacting systems approaches the transition state configuration of reactant and surrounding solvent in an incoherent manner that does not lend itself to direct experimental observation. Here we describe how gas-phase cluster chemistry can provide a detailed picture of the microscopic mechanics at play when a network of six water molecules mediates the trapping of a highly reactive "hydrated electron" onto a neutral CO(2) molecule to form a radical anion. The exothermic reaction is triggered from a metastable intermediate by selective excitation of either the reactant CO(2) or the water network, which is evidenced by the evaporative decomposition of the product cluster. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of energized CO(2){\textperiodcentered}(H(2)O)(6)(-) clusters are used to elucidate the nature of the network deformations that mediate intracluster electron capture, thus revealing the detailed solvent fluctuations implicit in the Marcus theory for electron-transfer kinetics in solution.},

annote = {Two hypotheses--``static'' and ``dynamic''--compete to plausibly explain the mechanism of Na+ vs K+ selectivity in voltage-gated Na+ channels. In the static hypothesis, Favre et al.,(55) based on a plethora of mutagenesis studies, speculated that the positively charged Lys ammonium could form a strong salt bridge with the negatively charged Asp/Glu carboxylate from the DEKA locus. This could constrain the pore size to dimensions that accommodate Na+ better than K+ or orient the coordinating O atoms to better suit the Na+ coordination requirements. In the dynamic hypothesis, Lipkind and Fozard,(60, 61) based on modeling studies of voltage-gated Na+ channels, proposed that the two acidic residues of the DEKA filter interact with the neighboring Lys in the metal-free filter. Since Na+ is a stronger Lewis acid than K+ (with its higher charge/size ratio), it can compete with the lysine's -NH3+ to bind to Glu/Asp, whereas K+ cannot displace Lys from its interactions with the carboxylates and thus cannot pass through the pore. Thus, selectivity is determined by the pore size/rigidity in the static hypothesis but by the ability of the permeating ion to compete with lysine's --NH3+ for the COO- moieties in the dynamic hypothesis.

The above summary of our current knowledge on the determinants of metal selectivity in Na+ channels raises the following intriguing questions: (1) Other than the pore size/rigidity of Na+ channels and metal-ligand electrostatic interactions, how do other factors such as the filter's dielectric properties, oligomericity, and chemical composition, as well as the cation's coordination number (CN, number of metal-bound ligands) and HN, affect the Na+ channel's selectivity? (2) In the epithelial Na+ channel, do the serines lining the pore bind to the metal cation via their backbone or side chain O atoms? (3) In the voltage-gated Na+ channel with the DEKA motif, how do the Lys protonation state and the Ala side chain orientation with respect to the pore lumen affect the channel's Na+/K+ selectivity? (4) How does the Lys in the DEKA motif play a pivotal role in selecting Na+ over K+? (5) Which of the two hypotheses--static or dynamic--is more plausible in explaining the mechanism of Na+/K+ selectivity in voltage-gated Na+ channels?},

We have taken the measure of "strength" to be the activation free energy at constant density, E-infinity(rho), for relaxation processes at relatively high temperatures; strong liquids, those with E-infinity(rho) much greater than kT over the relevant temperature range, relax via activated processes, whereas weak liquids do not. As the measure of "fragility" we have taken the curvature of the effective activation energy determined at temperatures well below the melting point where relaxation for all but the most nonfragile liquids appear to be activated. We have discussed a number of examples including weak-fragile and weak-nonfragile systems. We have suggested how these indicators of dynamical behavior might be correlated with thermodynamic indicators (entropy) and structural indicators (intermolecular interactions, structural frustration, collective interactions) as well as with other dynamical indicators such as the degree of nonexponentiality in the relaxation. We have also discussed the limitations of scaling data about the glass-transition temperature, T-g.},

Here we report that the clinical kinase inhibitor bosutinib recognizes its kinase targets by engaging a pair of conserved structured water molecules in the active site and that many other kinase inhibitors share a similar recognition mechanism. Using the nitrile group of bosutinib as an infrared probe, we show that the gatekeeper residue and one other position in the ATP-binding site control access of the drug to the structured water molecules and that the amino acids found at these positions account for the kinome-wide target spectrum of the drug. Our work highlights the importance of structured water molecules for inhibitor recognition, reveals a new role for the kinase gatekeeper and showcases an effective approach for elucidating the molecular origins of selectivity patterns.},

Building on previous studies of water in contact with different surfaces, in this study, we report results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of water near hydrophilic and hydrophobic interfaces in the presence of nonionic and ionic amphiphilic molecules, hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E6) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We elucidate how these surfactants affect the packing (i.e., density profiles) and orientation of interfacial water. The results highlight the interplay of both surfactant charges and the substrate charge distribution predominantly with respect to the orientation of water molecules, up to distances longer than those expected based on simulation results on flat solid surfaces. We also quantify the dynamics of interfacial water molecules by computing the residence probability for water in contact with various substrates. We compare our results to those previously obtained for interfacial water on silica and graphite and also with experimental sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy results at the air-water interface in the presence of surfactants. Our analysis could be useful for a better understanding of interfacial water not only near solid substrates but also near self-assembled/aggregated molecules at a variety of interfaces.},

The properties of the CD stretching transitions in leucine-d(10) as structural labels are studied via the methods of two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy. The cross peaks caused by interactions of the CD stretching modes with amide I (Am-I), CO, and amide II (Am-II) modes are obtained by the dual-frequency 2DIR method. The CD stretching peaks in leucine-d(10) are characterized using DFT computational modeling as well as relaxation-assisted 2DIR (RA 2DIR) measurements. The RA 2DIR measurements showed different enhancements and different energy transport times (arrival times) for different CD/Am-II and CD/CO cross peaks; a correlation between the intermode distance, the arrival time, and the amplification factor is reported. We demonstrated that the CD transitions of leucine-d(10) amino acid can serve as convenient structural reporters via the dual-frequency 2DIR methods and discussed the potential of leucine-d(10) and other amino acids with deuterium-labeled side chains as probes of protein structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {X-ray crystallography has been a useful tool in the development of site-directed spin labeling by resolving rotamers of the nitroxide spin-label side chain in a variety of $\alpha$-helical environments. In this work, the crystal structure of a doubly spin-labeled N8C/K28C mutant of the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB1) was solved. The double mutant formed a domain-swapped dimer under crystallization conditions. Two rotameric states of the spin-label were resolved at the solvent-exposed $\alpha$-helical site, at residue 28; these are in good agreement with rotamers previously reported for helical structures. The second site, at residue 8 on an interior $\beta$-strand, shows the presence of three distinct solvent-exposed side-chain rotamers. One of these rotamers is rarely observed within crystal structures of R1 sites and suggests that the H($\alpha$) and S($\delta$) hydrogen bond that is common to $\alpha$-helical sites is absent at this interior $\beta$-strand residue. Variable temperature continuous wave (CW) experiments of the $\beta$-strand site showed two distinct components that were correlated to the rotameric states observed in crystallography. Interestingly, the CW data at room temperature could be fit without the use of an order parameter, which is consistent with the lack of the H($\alpha$) and S($\delta$) interaction. Additionally, double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was performed on the GB1 double mutant in its monomeric form and yielded a most probable interspin distance of 25 ± 1 {\AA}. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the measured DEER distance, the rotamers observed in the crystal structure of the domain-swapped GB1 dimer were modeled into a high-resolution structure of the wild type monomeric GB1. The distances generated in the resulting GB1 structural models match the most probable DEER distance within $\sim$2 {\AA}. The results are interesting as they indicate by direct experimental measurement that the rotameric states of R1 found in this crystal provide a very close match to the most probable distance measured by DEER.},

abstract = {The nucleophilic aromatic substitution of some activated aryl or heteroaryl halides has been performed in ionic liquid solution, using the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium azide as a nucleophile. The reaction course was studied varying the structures of both substrates and ionic liquids. In particular, in the latter case, the reaction of 2-bromo-5-nitrothiophene was carried out in five different ionic liquids ([bmim][BF 4], [bmim][PF 6], [bmim][NTf 2], [bm 2im][NTf 2], and [bmpyrr][NTf 2]). Finally, for all the substrates considered, a comparison with data obtained in MeOH solution in the presence of NaN 3 was also performed. Data collected indicate that in some cases it is possible to obtain aromatic or heteroaromatic azide derivatives in satisfactory yield by means of a S NAr reaction using [bmim][N 3] as the nucleophile.},

abstract = {Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) possess molecular structures composed of fused rings with linear units linked together by a site of contortion so that the macromolecular structure is both rigid and highly non-linear. For PIM-1, which has previously demonstrated encouraging gas permeability data, the site of contortion is provided by the monomer 5,5′,6,6′-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindane. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of a PIM derived from the structurally related 6,6′,7,7′-tetrahydroxy-4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,2′-spirobischromane and copolymers prepared from combination of this monomer with other PIM-forming biscatechol monomers, including the highly rigid monomer 9,10-dimethyl-9,10-ethano-9,10-dihydro-2,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyanthracene. Generally, the polymers display good solubility in organic solvents and have high average molecular masses () in the range 80 000–200 000 g {\textperiodcentered} mol−1 and, therefore, are able to form robust, solvent-cast films. Gas permeability and selectivity for He, H2, N2, O2, CO2, and CH4 were measured for the polymers and compared to the values previously obtained for PIM-1. The spirobischromane-based polymers demonstrate enhanced selectivity for a number of gas pairs but with significantly lower values for permeability. The solubility coefficient for CO2 of two of the copolymers exceed even that of PIM-1, which previously demonstrated the highest value for a membrane-forming polymer. Therefore, these polymers might be useful for gas or vapor separations relying on solubility selectivity.},

abstract = {We present a general approach for modeling multidimensional infrared spectra based on a combination of phenomenological fitting and ab initio electronic structure calculations. The vibrational Hamiltonian is written in terms of bilinearly coupled Morse oscillators that represent local carbonyl stretches. This should be contrasted with the previous approach, where the anharmonic Hamiltonian was given in terms of normal-mode coordinates ( Baiz et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2009 , 113 , 9617 ). The bilinearly coupled Morse oscillator Hamiltonian is parametrized such that the frequencies and couplings are consistent with experiment, and the anharmonicities are computed by density functional theory. The advantages of the local-mode versus normal-mode approaches are discussed, as well as the ability of different density functionals to provide accurate estimates of the model parameters. The applicability and usefulness of the new approach are demonstrated in the context of the recently measured multidimensional infrared spectra of dimanganese decacarbonyl. The shifts in local site frequencies, couplings, and anharmonicities due to hydrogen bonding to the individual carbonyls are explored. It is found that, even though the effect of hydrogen bonding is nonlocal, it is additive.},

abstract = {Nitrile- and thiocyanate-derivatized amino acids have been found to be useful IR probes for investigating their local electrostatic environments in proteins. To shed light on the CN stretch frequency shift and spectral lineshape change induced by interactions with hydrogen-bonding solvent molecules, we carried out both classical and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for MeCN and MeSCN in water. These QM/MM and conventional force field MD simulation results were found to be inconsistent with the experimental results as well as with the high-level ab initio calculation results of MeCN-water and MeSCN-water potential energies. Thus, a new set of atomic partial charges of MeCN and MeSCN is obtained. By using the MD simulation trajectories and the electrostatic potential model recently developed, the CN and SCN stretching mode frequency trajectories were obtained and used to simulate the IR spectra. The CwN frequency blueshifts of MeCN and MeSCN in water are estimated to be 9.0 and 1.9 cm−1, respectively, in comparison with those of gas phase values. These values are found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured IR spectra of MeCN, MeSCN,\beta-cyano-L-alanine, and cyanylated cysteine in water and other polar solvents.},

abstract = {Fast protein dynamics can be missed with techniques that have relatively slow observation times. Using 2D IR spectroscopy and isotope labeling, we have probed the rapid, picosecond dynamics of a membrane protein in its native environment. By measuring the homogeneous and inhomogeneous IR linewidths of 11 amide I modes (backbone carbonyl stretch), we have captured the structural distributions and dynamics of the CD3$\zeta$ protein along its transmembrane segment that are lost with slower time-scale techniques. We find that the homogeneous lifetimes and population relaxation times are the same for almost all of the residues. In contrast, the inhomogeneous linewidths vary significantly with the largest inhomogeneous distribution occurring for residues near the N terminus and the narrowest near the center. This behavior is highly consistent with a recently reported experimental model of the protein and water accessibility as observed by molecular dynamics simulations. The data support the proposed CD3$\zeta$ peptide structure, and the simulations point to the structural disorder of water and lipid head-groups as the main source of inhomogeneous broadening. Taken together, this rigorous analysis of the vibrational dynamics of a membrane peptide provides experimental insight into a time regime of motions that has so far been largely unexplored.},

We find that the timescale for hydrogen-bond switching dynamics at the surface is about three times slower than that in the bulk. In contrast, with this model rotational dynamics are slightly faster at the surface than in the bulk. We consider vibrational two-dimensional (2D) sum-frequency generation (2DSFG) spectroscopy as a technique for observing hydrogen-bond rearrangement dynamics at the water surface. We calculate the nonlinear susceptibility for this spectroscopy for two different polarization conditions, and in each case we see the appearance of cross-peaks on the timescale of a few picoseconds, signaling hydrogen-bond rearrangement on this timescale. We thus conclude that this 2D spectroscopy will be an excellent experimental technique for observing slow hydrogen-bond switching dynamics at the water surface.},

In KSCN aqueous solutions of various concentrations, the rotational time constants of SCN(-) anions are proportional to the viscosities of the solutions. However, the reorientation dynamics of the water molecules are only slightly affected by the solution viscosity. With the addition of strongly hydrated F(-) anions, the rotations of both SCN(-) anions and water molecules slow down. With the addition of weakly hydrated I(-) anions, only the rotation of SCN(-) anions slows down with that of water molecules unaffected. Vibrational energy exchange measurements show that the separation among SCN(-) anions decreases with the addition of F(-) and increases with the addition of I(-). The series of experiments clearly demonstrate that both structures and dynamics of ion and water are segregated in the strong electrolyte aqueous solutions.},

Stark spectroscopy is a general term describing the study of spectral changes in the presence of electric fields, and it has proven to be a broadly useful approach for characterizing the change in dipole moment and polarizability for electronic and vibrational transitions. This article focuses primarily on the evolution of the approach and interconnected applications in diverse fields from our laboratory and prospects for the future. Our work began with studies of chromophores in photosynthetic reaction centers whose function is light-driven charge separation, so perturbations by an electric field were a natural approach. The same methods have been applied to many other biological and nonbiological chromophores. A common theme has been understanding the mechanism(s) of symmetry breaking in molecules or organized assemblies of high symmetry. Spectral shifts in organized systems due to mutations, conformational changes, and ligand binding can, in some cases, be interpreted as Stark shifts. In this case, Stark spectroscopy in a well-defined electric field provides a calibration of the probe transition's sensitivity to an electric field, and the Stark shifts of suitable probes can be used to measure the magnitude and direction of electric fields in proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. Electric fields can also perturb the populations or reaction dynamics of processes where charge separation occurs. When detected by spectroscopic methods, we call these nonclassical Stark effects. Nonclassical Stark effects arise in the spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer transitions and both ground- and excited-state electron transfer reactions. Because the movement of charge is ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science and because electric fields directly affect the energetics of charge-separated species, many phenomena can be viewed as generalizations of the Stark effect.},

abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) and atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analysis has been applied to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the enol conformers of malonaldehyde and its fluoro-, chloro-, cyano-, and nitro-substituted derivatives. With the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) method, good agreement between the DFT geometries and published experimental structures has been found. The donor-acceptor distance was also varied in a series of constrained optimizations in order to determine if energetic, structural, and topological trends associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonding remain valid in the intramolecular case. At very short donor-acceptor distances (<2.24 A), the hydrogen is symmetrically located between donor and acceptor; at distances longer than this, the hydrogen bonding is no longer symmetric. The AIM methodology has been applied to explore the topology of the electron density in the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the chosen model systems. Most AIM properties for intramolecular hydrogen bond distances longer than 2.24 A show smooth trends, consistent with intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Integrated AIM properties have also been used to explore the phenomenon of resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding (RAHB). It is shown that as the donor-acceptor distance is varied, pi-electron density is redistributed among the carbon atoms in the intramolecular hydrogen bond ring; however, contrary to prior studies, the integrated atomic charges on the donor-acceptor atoms were found to be insensitive to variation of hydrogen-bonding distance.},

abstract = {Time-resolved two-dimensional (2D) infrared spectra of the asymmetric stretch mode of solvated CO2 show distinct features corresponding to ground- and excited-state thermal populations of the bend modes. The time-dependence of these peaks arises in part from solvent-driven thermal fluctuations in populations of the lower-frequency bend modes through their coupling to the higher-frequency asymmetric stretch. This observation illustrates the capacity of multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy to reveal details of the interactions among vibrational modes in condensed phases. The optimized mean-trajectory (OMT) method is a trajectory-based semiclassical approach to computing the vibrational response functions of multidimensional spectroscopy from a classical Hamiltonian. We perform an OMT calculation of the 2D vibrational spectrum for two coupled anharmonic modes, with the lower-frequency mode undergoing stochastic transitions in energy to mimic solvent-induced fluctuations in quantum populations. The semiclassical calculation reproduces the influence of thermal fluctuations in the low-frequency mode on the 2D spectrum of the high-frequency mode, as in measured spectra of solvated CO2.},

abstract = {A nitrile-labeled amino acid, p-cyanophenylalanine, is introduced near the active site of the semisynthetic enzyme ribonuclease S to serve as a probe of protein dynamics and fluctuations. Ribonuclease S is the limited proteolysis product of subtilisin acting on ribonuclease A, and consists of a small fragment including amino acids 1–20, the S-peptide, and a larger fragment including residues 21–124, the S-protein. A series of two-dimensional vibrational echo experiments performed on the nitrile-labeled S-peptide and the RNase S are described. The time-dependent changes in the two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo line shapes are analyzed using the center line slope method to obtain the frequency–frequency correlation function (FFCF). The observations show that the nitrile probe in the S-peptide has dynamics that are similar to, but faster than, those of the single amino acid p-cyanophenylalanine in water. In contrast, the dynamics of the nitrile label when the peptide is bound to form ribonuclease S are dominated by homogeneous dephasing (motionally narrowed) contributions with only a small contribution from very fast inhomogeneous structural dynamics. The results provide insights into the nature of the structural dynamics of the ribonuclease S complex. The equilibrium dynamics of the nitrile labeled S-peptide and the ribonuclease S complex are also investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The experimentally determined FFCFs are compared to the FFCFs obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations, thereby testing the capacity of simulations to determine the amplitudes and time scales of protein structural fluctuations on fast time scales under thermal equilibrium conditions.},

Using a Likert-style survey administered pre- and postcourse, we found significant changes in students' confidence in their ability to read and analyze primary literature, self-assessed understanding of the nature of science, and epistemological beliefs (e.g., their sense of whether knowledge is certain and scientific talent innate). Thus, within a single semester, the inexpensive C.R.E.A.T.E. method can shift not just students' analytical abilities and understanding of scientists as people, but can also positively affect students' confidence with analysis of primary literature, their insight into the processes of science, and their beliefs about learning.},

abstract = {The mechanism of vibrational energy flow is studied in a regime where a diffusion equation is likely to break down, i.e., on length scales of a few chemical bonds and time scales of a few picoseconds. This situation occurs, for example, during photochemical reactions in protein environment. To that end, a toy model is introduced that on the one hand mimics the vibrational normal mode distribution of proteins, and on the other hand is small enough to numerically time propagate the system fully quantum mechanically. Comparing classical and quantum-mechanical results, the question is addressed to what extent the classical nature of the molecular dynamics simulations (which would be the only choice for the modeling of a real molecular system) affects the vibrational energy flow mechanism. Small differences are found which are due to the different ways classical and quantum mechanics distribute thermal energy over vibrational modes. In either case, a ballistic and a diffusive phase can be identified. For these small length and time scales, the latter is governed by intrasite vibrational energy redistribution, since vibrational energy does not necessarily thermalize completely within individual peptide units. Overall, the model suggests a picture that unifies many of the observations made recently in experiments.},

We have developed a new NAD(+) analog 3-Picolyl Azide Adenine Dinucleotide (PAAD(+)), which has the potential to be a general spectroscopic probe for NAD-dependent enzymes. This analog is stable and binds in the active site of a typical NAD-dependent enzyme formate dehydrogenase (FDH) with similar characteristics to natural NAD(+). It has an isolated infrared transition with high molar absorptivity that makes it suitable for observing enzyme dynamics using 2D IR spectroscopy. 2D IR experiments show that in aqueous solution, the analog undergoes complete spectral diffusion within hundreds of femtoseconds consistent with the water hydrogen bonding dynamics that would be expected. When bound to FDH in a binary complex, it shows picosecond fluctuations and a large static offset, consistent with previous studies of the binary complexes of this enzyme. These results show that PAAD(+) is an excellent probe of local dynamics and that it should be a general tool for probing the dynamics of a wide range of NAD-dependent enzymes.},

abstract = {To provide evidence for the interpretation of temperature-dependent unfolding kinetics and the downhill unfolding scenario presented in the accompanying experimental article (Part I), the free energy surface of ubiquitin unfolding is calculated using statistical mechanical models of the Mu{\~{n}}oz-Eaton (ME) form. The models allow only two states for each amino acid residue, folded or unfolded, and permutations of these states generate an ensemble of microstates. One-dimensional free energy curves are calculated using the number of folded residues as a reaction coordinate. The proposed sequential unfolding of ubiquitin's $\beta$-sheet is tested by mapping the free energy onto two reaction coordinates inspired by the experiment as follows: the number of folded residues in ubiquitin's stable $\beta$-strands I and II and those of the less stable strands III–V. Although the original ME model successfully captures folding features of zipper-like one-dimensional folders, it misses important tertiary interactions between residues that are far from each other in primary sequence. To take tertiary contacts into account, partially folded microstates based on a spherical growth model are included in the calculation and compared with the original model. By calculating the folding probability of each residue for a given point on the free energy surface, the unfolding pathway of ubiquitin is visualized. At low temperature, thermal unfolding occurs along a sequential unfolding pathway as follows: disruption of the $\beta$-strands III–V followed by unfolding of the strands I and II. At high temperature, multiple unfolding routes are formed. The heterogeneity of the transition state explains the global nonexponential unfolding observed in the T-jump experiment at high temperature. The calculation also reports a high stability for the $\alpha$-helix of ubiquitin.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have received growing consideration as a prospective decarbonization solvent. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on flue gases with specific compositions and flow rates, which makes it a challenging task to use ILs with divergent CO2 emission scenarios for the comprehensive carbon management. In this work, complete conceptual designs for absorption processes 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([bmim][Ac]) are developed for separating at least 90% of CO2 from the feed before pressurizing it to 150 bar to the sequestration sites over a broad range of CO2 flue gas compositions and flow rates.

The simulation results show that compared to conventional processes, IL-based processes are only quite economical at high flue gas flow rates and CO2 contents.

abstract = {<p>Spectroscopic techniques such as UV/vis, NMR, and Raman are powerful tools for the investigation of chemical speciation in solution. However, it is not widely recognized that such techniques do not always provide reliable information about ion association equilibria. Specifically, spectroscopic measurements do not in general produce thermodynamically meaningful association constants for non-contact ion pairs, where the ions are separated by one or more solvent molecules. Such systems can only be properly quantified by techniques such as dielectric or ultrasonic relaxation, which can detect all ion-pair types (or equilibria), or by traditional thermodynamic methods, which detect the overall level of association. Various types of quantitative data are presented for metal ion/sulfate systems in aqueous solution that demonstrate the inadequacy of the major spectroscopic techniques for the investigation of systems that involve solvent-separated ion pairs. The implications for ion association equilibria in general are briefly discussed.</p>},

abstract = {In more than one way pure ionic liquids (ILs) can be seen as mixtures. By definition they are comprised of cationic and anionic components and they also possess dual charge and apolar characteristics. We recently uncovered interesting dynamical behavior [Araque et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 119(23), 7015 (2015)] that can be ascribed to this duality. For small neutral solutes local friction can be high in certain regions and much lower in others. It is only reasonable to ask whether this interesting behavior is unique to ILs or is also common in certain conventional solvent mixtures such as dimethylsufoxide/glycerol for which the viscosity can be tuned to be similar. We make the case that the latter scenario is correct and that whereas viscous conventional solvent mixtures are structurally very different from ILs, dynamically they are not. From the perspective of a solute that is small, both ILs and viscous conventional solvent mixtures display frictionally stiff and soft regions associated with cage and jump diffusive regimes. In the case of ILs these are associated with charge-enhanced and charge-depleted liquid regions, whereas in the case of the conventional solvents by the distinct frictional properties of the two components.},

abstract = {In the present computational work, we develop a new tool for our trajectory analysis program TRAVIS to analyze the well-known behavior of liquids to separate into microphases. The dissection of the liquid into domains of different subsets, for example, in the case of fluorinated ionic liquids with anionic and cationic head groups (forming together the polar domain), fluorous, and alkyl subsets is followed by radical Voronoi tessellation. This leads to useful average quantities of the subset neighbor count, that is, the domain count that gives the amount of particular domains in the liquid, the domain volume and surface, as well as the isoperimetric quotient, which provides a measure of the deviation of the domains from a spherical shape. Thus, the newly implemented method allows analysis of the domains in terms of their numbers and shapes on a qualitative and also quantitative basis. It is a simple, direct, and automated analysis that does not need evaluation of the structure beforehand in terms of, for example, first solvent shell minima. In the microheterogeneous ionic liquids that we used as examples, the polar subsets always form a single domain in all investigated liquids. Although the fluorous side chains are also more or less connected in one or, maximally, two domains, the alkyl phases are dispersed.},

abstract = {Cooperativity in ionic liquids is investigated by means of static quantum chemical calculations. Larger clusters of the dimethylimidazolium cation paired with a chloride anion are calculated within density functional theory combined with gradient corrected functionals. Tests of the monomer unit show that density functional theory performs reasonably well. Linear chain and ring aggregates have been considered and geometries are found to be comparable with liquid phase structures. Cooperative effects occur when the total energy of the oligomer differs from a simple sum of monomer energies. Cooperative effects have been found in the structural motifs examined. A systematic study of linear chains of increasing length (up to nine monomer units) has shown that cooperativity plays a more important role than expected and is stronger than in water. The Cl...H distance of the chloride to the most acidic proton increases with an increasing number of monomer units. The average bond distance approaches 218.9 pm asymptotically. The dipole moment grows almost linearly and the dipole moment per monomer unit reaches the asymptotic value of 16.3 D. The charge on the chloride atoms decreases with an increasing chain length. In order to detect local hydrogen bonding in the clusters a new parametrization of the shared-electron number method is introduced. We find decreasing hydrogen bond energies with an increasing cluster size for both the first hydrogen bond to the most acidic proton and the average hydrogen bond.},

Much of this work relies on the high relaxivity of nanometer-sized, ultrasmall dextran-coated iron oxide particles. Typically, millions of dextran-coated ultrasmall iron oxide particles must be loaded into cells for efficient detection. Here we show that single, micrometer-sized iron oxide particles (MPIOs) can be detected by MRI in vitro in agarose samples, in cultured cells, and in mouse embryos. Experiments studying effects of MRI resolution and particle size from 0.76 to 1.63 microm indicated that T(2)* effects can be readily detected from single MPIOs at 50-microm resolution and significant signal effects could be detected at resolutions as low as 200 microm. Cultured cells were labeled with fluorescent MPIOs such that single particles were present in individual cells. These single particles in single cells could be detected both by MRI and fluorescence microscopy. Finally, single particles injected into single-cell-stage mouse embryos could be detected at embryonic day 11.5, demonstrating that even after many cell divisions, daughter cells still carry individual particles. These results demonstrate that MRI can detect single particles and indicate that single-particle detection will be useful for cellular imaging.},

The H-bond cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered. This water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, rather than the commonly accepted sequence of small diffusive steps, and therefore calls for reinterpretation of many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation is assumed to be diffusive.},

abstract = {The anomalous properties of cold and supercooled water, such as the fact that at sufficiently low temperatures it becomes more compressible and less dense when cooled, and more fluid when compressed, have attracted the attention of physical scientists for a long time. The discovery in the 1970s that several thermodynamic and transport properties of supercooled water exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence and appear to diverge slightly below the homogeneous nucleation temperature inspired a large number of experimental and theoretical studies. Likewise, an important body of work on glassy water has been stimulated by experiments, starting in the mid-1980s and continuing to this date, which suggest that vitreous water can exist in at least two apparently distinct forms. A coherent theory of the thermodynamic and transport properties of supercooled and glassy water does not yet exist. Nevertheless, significant progress towards this goal has been made during the past 20 years. This article summarizes the known experimental facts and reviews critically theoretical and computational work aimed at interpreting the observations and providing a unified viewpoint on cold, non-crystalline, metastable states of water.},

abstract = {Optical heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect (OHD-OKE) experiments are used to study the orientational dynamics of the liquid crystal 4′-octyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (8CB) in the isotropic phase near the isotropic to nematic phase transition. The results are compared to those for three other liquid crystals. The 8CB data display a short time scale temperature independent power law decay and a long time scale exponential decay with a temperature dependence described by Landau–de Gennes theory. The power law exponent is −0.56. Combining this result with previous results for three other liquid crystals [J. Chem. Phys. 116 (2002) 6339; J. Chem. Phys. 116 (2002) 360], it is found that the power law exponent depends linearly on the aspect ratio of the liquid crystal.},

abstract = {The potential for femtosecond to picosecond time-scale motions to influence the rate of the intrinsic chemical step in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is a source of significant controversy. Among the central challenges in resolving this controversy is the difficulty of experimentally characterizing thermally activated motions at this time scale in functionally relevant enzyme complexes. We report a series of measurements to address this problem using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to characterize the time scales of active-site motions in complexes of formate dehydrogenase with the transition-state-analog inhibitor azide (N(3)(-)). We observe that the frequency-frequency time correlation functions (FFCF) for the ternary complexes with NAD(+) and NADH decay completely with slow time constants of 3.2 ps and 4.6 ps, respectively. This result suggests that in the vicinity of the transition state, the active-site enzyme structure samples a narrow and relatively rigid conformational distribution indicating that the transition-state structure is well organized for the reaction. In contrast, for the binary complex, we observe a significant static contribution to the FFCF similar to what is seen in other enzymes, indicating the presence of the slow motions that occur on time scales longer than our measurement window.},

Both ionic liquids have the same cation, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, but different trifluoromethyl-containing anions. One has a strongly hydrophobic anion, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, while the second has a hydrophilic anion, trifluoromethylsulfonate. Transport of water in these ionic liquids is much faster than would be predicted from hydrodynamic laws, indicating that the neutral water molecules experience a very different friction than the anions and cations at the molecular level. Temperature-dependent viscosities, conductivities, and densities are reported as a function of water concentration to further analyze the properties of the ionic liquid-water mixtures. These results on the properties of water in ionic liquids should be of interest to researchers in diverse areas ranging from separations, solubilizing biomass and energy technologies.},

abstract = {For an ideal absorbent for CO2 capture from flue gas, there are some key features including easy preparation, high stability, low absorption enthalpy, high capacity at high temperature and excellent reversibility. Herein, several polyamine-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) were easily prepared from cheap polyamines and lithium salts, which exhibited significantly improved stability due to the presence of multisite coordinating interactions. The viscosity was reduced by introducing polyalcohol-based ILs, leading to polyamine-based hybrid ILs. Interestingly, these polyamine-based hybrid ILs exhibited high CO2 capacity (4.09 mmol/g, 0.1 bar) at high temperature (80°C) and excellent reversibility in the presence of H2O and O2, which is superior to many other good absorbents. Moreover, these ILs also showed good performance for CO2 capture from stimulated air (2.10 mmol/g, 380 ppm). We believe that this method with easy preparation, low cost, high efficiency and excellent reversibility has a great potential in the industrial capture of CO2 from flue gas.},

DSC measurements revealed subambient melting and glass transition temperatures. Analysis of the anion and cation diffusion coefficients suggested that the cation was the dominant charge carrier and that the motion was largely independent of the anion. Haven ratios (H Rs) of 1 and 1.6 were determined for the imide and triflate salts, respectively, at 30 ??C (303 K). Values greater than one imply some degree of ionic association, suggesting that aggregation is present in the triflate salt. Mixing of the salts to form binary systems resulted in enhanced conductivities which deviated from a simple law of mixtures. Thermal analysis showed no evidence of a melting point with only a glass transition observed. Corresponding diffusion measurements for the binaries appeared to show a weighted average of the diffusion coefficients of the pure components. The increased conductivity can be attributed to an increase in the number of charge carriers as a result of decreased ion association in the binary.},

abstract = {We developed a mass spectrometric method to determine the p K a values of individual histidine residues in proteins. The method is based on the fact that the imidazole C 2-proton undergoes pH-dependent hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction, of which the rate constant ( k phi) reflects the p K a for the ionization of imidazole to imidazolium. The experimental procedure consists of the following: (1) protein incubation in D 2O solvent at various pH values, (2) protein digestion by proteolytic enzyme(s), during which all the rapidly exchanging deuterons such as those in amide and hydroxyl groups are back-exchanged for protons, and (3) measurement of the mass spectrum of each histidine-containing peptide by LC/ESI-MS. The k phi of the H-D exchange reaction is obtained from the mass spectrum reflecting the extent of deuterium incorporation. The p K a value is then determined from a plot of k phi versus pH, which gives a typical sigmoidal curve. Unambiguous assignment of the p K a values to individual histidine residues can be achieved simultaneously based on the observed molecular mass of the peptide. The p K a values of three of four histidine residues (His12, -105, and -119) in RNase A were successfully determined by this method and were in good agreement with those determined by (1)H NMR and hydrogen-tritium exchange methods. The method uses subnanomole quantities of protein, allowing measurement at a much lower concentration than that of 1 mM required for the conventional NMR approach that is currently almost exclusively the method of choice.},

abstract = {Solute-solvent interactions between acetate and D(2)O were investigated by vibrational spectroscopic methods. The vibrational dynamics of the COO asymmetric stretching mode in D(2)O was observed by time-resolved infrared (IR) pump-probe spectroscopy. The pump-probe signal contained both decay and oscillatory components. The time dependence of the decay component could be explained by a double exponential function with time constants of 200 fs and 2.6 ps, which are the same for both the COO asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. The Fourier spectrum of the oscillatory component contained a band around 80 cm(-1), which suggests that the COO asymmetric stretching mode couples to a low-frequency vibrational mode with a wavenumber of 80 cm(-1). Based on quantum chemistry calculations, we propose that a bridged complex comprising an acetate ion and one D(2)O molecule, in which the two oxygen atoms in the acetate anion form hydrogen bonds with the two deuterium atoms in D(2)O, is the most stable structure. The 80 cm(-1) low-frequency mode was assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the hydrogen bond in the bridged complex.},

abstract = {Transient two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy is used as a probe of protein unfolding dynamics in a direct comparison of fast unfolding experiments with molecular dynamics simulations. In the experiments, the unfolding of ubiquitin is initiated by a laser temperature jump, and protein structural evolution from nanoseconds to milliseconds is probed using amide I 2D IR spectroscopy. The temperature jump prepares a subensemble near the unfolding transition state, leading to quasi-barrierless unfolding (the "burst phase") before the millisecond activated unfolding kinetics. The burst phase unfolding of ubiquitin is characterized by a loss of the coupling between vibrations of the beta-sheet, a process that manifests itself in the 2D IR spectrum as a frequency blue-shift and intensity decrease of the diagonal and cross-peaks of the sheet's two IR active modes. As the sheet unfolds, increased fluctuations and solvent exposure of the beta-sheet amide groups are also characterized by increases in homogeneous linewidth. Experimental spectra are compared with 2D IR spectra calculated from the time-evolving structures in a molecular dynamics simulation of ubiquitin unfolding. Unfolding is described as a sequential unfolding of strands in ubiquitin's beta-sheet, using two collective coordinates of the sheet: (i) the native interstrand contacts between adjacent beta-strands I and II and (ii) the remaining beta-strand contacts within the sheet. The methods used illustrate the general principles by which 2D IR spectroscopy can be used for detailed dynamical comparisons of experiment and simulation.},

Amide I, a primarily carbonyl stretching vibration of the protein backbone, provides information on secondary structures as a result of vibrational cou-plings and on hydrogen-bonding contacts when isotope labeling is used to isolate specific sites. In parallel with experiments, computational models of amide I spectra that use atomistic structures from molecular dynamics sim-ulations have evolved to calculate experimental spectra. Mixed quantum-classical models use spectroscopic maps to translate the structural infor-mation into a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian for the spectroscopically observed vibrations. This allows one to model the spectroscopy of large proteins, disordered states, and protein conformational dynamics. With im-provements in amide I models, quantitative modeling of time-dependent structural ensembles and of direct feedback between experiments and simu-lations is possible. We review the advances in developing these models, their theoretical basis, and current and future applications.},

abstract = {Ultrafast infrared frequency selected vibrational echo (FSVE) experiments are used to study temperaturedependent dynamic interactions in liquids, glasses, and proteins. Vibrational echo experiments measure vibrational dephasing. In general, the large bandwidths associated with ultrashort IR pulses will excite multiple vibrational transitions of a molecular system. In addition to the 0-1 transition of a particular mode of interest, the 1-2 transition, other modes, combination bands, and modes of other species can be excited. A onedimensional vibrational echo experiment involving multiple transitions can be difficult to address theoretically. By selecting the proper detection wavelengths (a frequency slice through a 2D time-frequency vibrational echo), FSVE makes it possible to effectively isolate a two state system (in terms of the dynamical experimental observables) from within a complex multistate system. First, the FSVE method is used to study the dynamics of CO stretching mode of RuTPPCOPy (TPP ) 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin, Py ) pyridine) in two solvents: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF). The results demonstrate the fundamental difference in the influence of a glassy and a liquid solvent on vibrational dephasing. In PMMA, a glass at all temperatures studied, the dephasing rate is linear in temperature. In 2-MTHF, the dephasing is linear for temperatures below Tg, but it changes form, becoming very steep slightly above Tg. Calculations using a model frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) show that the different temperature dependences in PMMA and 2-MTHF can be modeled in a unified manner, with at least two solvent motions contributing to the dephasing in liquids, that is, inertial and diffusive motions. FSVE is then applied to the study of the dynamics of the protein myoglobin in water by observing the vibrational dephasing of the stretching mode of CO bound to the active site of myoglobin (Mb-CO). The A1 and A3 conformational substates of Mb-CO are found to have different dephasing rates with different temperature dependences. A frequency-frequency correlation function derived from molecular dynamics simulations of Mb-CO at 298 K is used to calculate the vibrational echo decay. The calculated decay shows substantial agreement with the experimentally measured decays. The FSVE experiment probes protein dynamics and provides an observable that can be used to test structural assignments for the Mb-CO conformational substates.},

The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis.

Four ILs are studied, each having the same bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anion in common. Two of the ILs have aliphatic 1-alkyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium cations, while the other two ILs have aromatic 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations. ILs with both shorter (butyl) and longer (octyl or decyl) cationic alkyl substituents are studied. NOE NMR results suggest that the local environment of IL anions and cations near the Ru2+(bpy)3 solute is rather different from the bulk IL structure. The solute–anion and solute–cation interactions are significantly different both for ILs with short vs long alkyl tails and for ILs with aliphatic vs aromatic cation polar head groups. In particular, the solute–anion interactions are observed to be about 3 times stronger for the cations with shorter alkyl tails relative to the ILs with longer alkyl tails. The Ru2+(bpy)3 solute interacts with both the polar head and the nonpolar tail groups of the 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium cation but only with the nonpolar tail groups of the 1-decyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium cation.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are pure salts that are liquid under ambient conditions. As liquids composed solely of ions, the scientific consensus has been that ionic liquids have exceedingly high ionic strengths and thus very short Debye screening lengths. However, several recent experiments from laboratories around the world have reported data for the approach of two surfaces separated by ionic liquids which revealed remarkable long range forces that appear to be electrostatic in origin. Evidence has accumulated demonstrating long range surface forces for several different combinations of ionic liquids and electrically charged surfaces, as well as for concentrated mixtures of inorganic salts in solvent. The original interpretation of these forces, that ionic liquids could be envisioned as ''dilute electrolytes,'' was controversial, and the origin of long range forces in ionic liquids remains the subject of discussion. Here we seek to collate and examine the evidence for long range surface forces in ionic liquids, identify key outstanding questions, and explore possible mechanisms underlying the origin of these long range forces. Long range surface forces in ionic liquids and other highly concentrated electrolytes hold diverse implications from designing ionic liquids for energy storage applications to rationalizing electrostatic correlations in biological self-assembly. Ions impact all aspects of modern life. The smart phones that link much of the Earth's population are powered by batteries that depend on the directed motion of large collections of ions. 1 Collective ion motion will also play a key role in energy storage technologies that will enable societies to transition away from fossil fuels to greener energy sources, such as supercapacitors, 2 and the correlated behaviour of ions is responsible for many biological processes that support life. 3 Consequently, a complete understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the behaviour of large collections of ions would impact many branches of science and engineering, and allow ion collective motion to be predictably tuned. This is a tremendous challenge, in large part due to the large potential energy of electrostatic interactions and long range of electrostatic interactions. In particular, analytical theories describing disordered soft matter systems, like liquid-based energy storage devices and biological systems, are sparse, and such systems are too complex to be reliably simulated. 4 Increasingly, researchers are exploring the physics of ionic liquids to provide general insight into the fundamental nature of ionic correlations, as ionic liquids are comparatively simple systems that exhibit the key features of electrostatic correla-tions in disordered soft matter. Ionic liquids are pure salts that are liquids at ambient conditions. 5 Strong electrostatic interactions determine the key properties of ionic liquids, as for traditional high melting point salts. In contrast with traditional salts, ionic liquids are typically composed of large, asymmetric polyatomic ions with ionic radii that are about 5–10 times larger than those of monatomic ions like Li + or K + .

abstract = {The viscoelastic relaxation characteristics of ultraviolet crosslinked net- works based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate [PEGDA] have been investigated by dynamic mechanical methods. Effective crosslink density in the networks was varied via the use of PEGDA prepolymers of different molecular weight, or by the introduc- tion of controlled amounts of water in the reaction mixture. In all cases examined, fully amorphous networks were obtained. Time–temperature superposition was applied to obtain master curves of storage modulus versus frequency across the glass transition, and these could be satisfactorily described using the Kohlrausch– Williams–Watts relaxation function. The glass transition temperature (Tg), relaxation breadth, and fragility of the segmental relaxation were correlated with the effective crosslink density obtained in the networks. Gas permeation measurements on the PEGDA/water networks indicated only a very modest variation in gas transport prop- erties, despite the sizeable variation in apparent crosslink density achieved in these materials. This result suggests that the controlling structural factor for gas transport in the networks is not simply crosslink density, and that attempts to correlate gas transport to network structure must necessarily consider the broader relationships between crosslink density, segmental mobility, and fractional free volume.},

The steady-state and rotational relaxation data indicate that C-153 molecules are incorporated in the core of the microemulsions. The average rotational relaxation time increases with increase in w ([bmim][BF(4)]/[TX-100]) values. The solvent relaxation in the core of the microemulsion occurs on two different time scales and is almost insensitive to the increase in w values. The solvent relaxation is retarded in the pool of the microemulsions compared to the neat solvent. Though, the retardation is very small compared to several-fold retardation of the solvation time of the conventional solvent inside the pool of the microemulsions.},

Gas separation properties in the networks are sensitive to copolymer composition, temperature, and carbon dioxide fugacity in the feed. In conventional approaches, the effect of temperature can be described by the Arrhenius equation, while the influence of copolymer composition and fugacity can only be described empirically; the corresponding models require a large number of adjustable parameters. However, as shown here, the three factors influencing gas transport correlate well with free volume, and a simplified free volume model with only two adjustable parameters can satisfactorily describe the effects of copolymer composition, temperature, and CO2 fugacity on pure- and mixed-gas transport properties. Copolymer composition and temperature can be directly related to the fractional free volume, while CO2 fugacity of the feed can be correlated with free volume via the glass transition temperature of the polymer-gas mixture, which is computed using Chow's model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results obtained show that, upon confinement, the ionic interactions between the ILs with the cationic surfactant polar head group and the surfactant counterion modify substantially the performance of both ILs as solvents. In toluene/BHDC/bmimCl RMs, the Cl? interacts strongly with bmim+ (and/or BHD+) in such a way that its nucleophilicity is reduced in comparison with neat IL. In toluene/BHDC/bmimBF4 RMs, an ionic exchange equilibrium produces segregation of bmim+ and BF4? ions, changing the composition of the RMs interface and affecting dramatically the Cl? availability. These results show the versatility of this kind of organized system to alter the ionic organization and influence on reaction rate when used as nanoreactors.},

abstract = {The dynamics of four 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) with carbon chain lengths of 2, 4, 6, and 10 were studied by measuring the orientational and spectral diffusion dynamics of the vibrational probe SeCN − . Vibrational absorption spectra, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR), and polarization-selective pump−probe (PSPP) experiments were performed on the CN stretch. In addition, optical heterodyne-detected optical Kerr effect (OHD-OKE) experiments were performed on the bulk liquids. The PSPP experiments yielded triexponential anisotropy decays, which were analyzed with the wobbling-in-a-cone model. The slowest decay, the complete orientational randomization, slows with increasing chain length in a hydrodynamic trend consistent with the increasing viscosity. The shortest time scale wobbling motions are insensitive to chain length, while the intermediate time scale wobbling slows mildly as the chain length increases. The 2D IR spectra measured in parallel (⟨XXXX⟩) and perpendicular (⟨XXYY⟩) polarization configurations gave different decays, showing that reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD) contributes to the dynamics. The spectral diffusion caused by the RTIL structural fluctuations was obtained by removing the RISD contributions. The faster structural fluctuations are relatively insensitive to chain length. The slowest structural fluctuations slow substantially when going from Emim (2 carbon chain) to Bmim (4 carbon chain) and slow further, but more gradually, as the chain length is increased. It was shown previously that K + causes local ion clustering in the Emim RTIL. The K + effect increases with increasing chain length. The OHD-OKE measured complete structural randomization times slow substantially with increasing chain length and are much slower than the dynamics experienced by the SeCN − located in the ionic regions of the RTILs.},

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to characterize the vibrational dynamics in terms of dihedral angle motion between the two carboxylate planes and solvation dynamics. The localization of the oxalate vibrational excitation onto the carboxylates is induced by the fluctuations in the carboxylate vibrational frequencies which are shown by theory and experiment to have a similar correlation time as the anisotropy decay.},

abstract = {Water was originally inimical to ionic liquids (ILs) especially in the analysis of their detailed properties. Various data on the properties of ILs indicate that there are two ways to design functions of ionic liquids. The first is to change the structure of component ions, to provide "task-specific ILs". The second is to mix ILs with other components, such as other ILs, organic solvents or water. Mixing makes it easy to control the properties of the solution. In this strategy, water is now a very important partner. Below, we summarise our recent results on the properties of IL/water mixtures. Stable phase separation is an effective method in some separation processes. Conversely, a dynamic phase change between a homogeneous mixture and separation of phases is important in many fields. Analysis of the relation between phase behaviour and the hydration state of the component ions indicates that the pattern of phase separation is governed by the hydrophilicity of the ions. Sufficiently hydrophilic ions yielded ILs that are miscible with water, and hydrophobic ions gave stable phase separation with water. ILs composed of hydrophobic but hydrated ions undergo a dynamic phase change between a homogeneous mixture and separate phases according to temperature. ILs having more than seven water molecules per ion pair undergo this phase transition. These dynamic phase changes are considered, with some examples, and application is made to the separation of water-soluble proteins.},

Series of 1 : 1 electrolytes were studied, with constant cation and varying anion, and vice versa, to determine the effects of chan ing the ionic radius. Results were also obtained for some multivalent ions. Measurements were made at wave lengths of 1.17, 3.12 and 10.00 cm. Densities and audiofrequency conductivities of the same solutions were determined. From these primary data were determined relaxation times, arameters describing the extent of distribution of the relaxation times, and limiting values of the dielectric constant at pow and high frequencies. At high concentrations, broad distributions of relaxation times are found with the central relaxation often several times slower than that of pure water. The low frequency dielectric constant (eo) is not linear in the concentration. Lar4e c0 (>30) are obtained even at the highest concentrations (10-12 M). Larger dielectric decrements are assigned to cation8 than to anions, although greater entrop deerements are enerally ascribed to anions, a seemingly aradoxical situation. It is indicated how this can be explaineiin terms of mod\& for cationic a,nd anionic hydration whici incorporate the important difference that nearest neighbor water molecules interact.through both lone pairs with a given cation but through a single hydrogen bond type linkage to a given anion. The low frequency dielectric increments are discussed with reference to an extension to ionic solutions of the statistical mechanical theory of dielectric polarization.

The anisotropy decay in the isotopically mixed methanol solution is a biexponential characterized by 1.7±0.7 ps and 17±3 ps time constants, with 40±10% of the decay occurring with the slower time constant. The biexponential anisotropy decay has been analyzed with a restricted orientational diffusion model that involves fast orientational diffusion within a cone of semi-angle $\theta$c,$\theta$c, followed by slower, full orientational relaxation. The fast orientational relaxation occurs within a cone semi-angle of $\theta$c=45°±5°,$\theta$c=45°±5°, with a diffusion coefficient of D−1c=13±5 ps.Dc−1=13±5 ps. The slower anisotropy decay results from the full orientational diffusion and occurs with a diffusion coefficient of D−1$\theta$=100±20 ps.D$\theta$−1=100±20 ps. The anisotropy decay for isotopically pure methanol-d in CCl4CCl4 is much faster because of vibrational excitation transfer in addition to the orientational relaxation. The excitation transfer has been successfully analyzed as transition dipole–transition dipole mediated transfer using a theory developed for randomly distributed chromophores.},

abstract = {The energetically unfavorable termination of the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules at the air/water interface causes molecular rearrangement to minimize the free energy. The long-standing question is how water minimizes the surface free energy. The combination of advanced, surface-specific nonlinear spectroscopy and theoretical simulation provides new insights. The complex $\chi$((2)) spectra of isotopically diluted water surfaces obtained by heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation show excellent agreement, assuring the validity of the microscopic picture given in the simulation. The present study indicates that there is no ice-like structure at the surface-in other words, there is no increase of tetrahedrally coordinated structure compared to the bulk-but that there are water pairs interacting with a strong hydrogen bond at the outermost surface. Intuitively, this can be considered a consequence of the lack of a hydrogen bond toward the upper gas phase, enhancing the lateral interaction at the boundary. This study also confirms that the major source of the isotope effect on the water $\chi$((2)) spectra is the intramolecular anharmonic coupling, i.e., Fermi resonance.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which pyridinium (pyrH(+)) is reduced at a Pt electrode is a matter of recent controversy. The quasireversible cyclic voltammetric wave observed at -0.58 V vs SCE at a Pt electrode was originally proposed to correspond to reduction of pyrH(+) to pyridinyl radical (pyrH(•)). This mechanistic explanation for the observed electrochemistry seems unlikely in light of recent quantum mechanical calculations that predict a very negative reduction potential (-1.37 V vs SCE) for the formation of pyrH(•). Several other mechanisms have been proposed to account for the discrepancy in calculated and observed reduction potentials, including surface adsorption of pyrH(•), reduction of pyrH(+) by two electrons rather than one, and reduction of the pyrH(+) proton to a surface hydride rather than a $\pi$-based radical product. This final mechanism, which can be described as inner-sphere reduction of pyrH(+) to form a surface hydride, is consistent with experimental observations.},

The markedly different structural sensitivities of the experimental probes allow the construction of a detailed three-dimensional atomistic model using the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) technique. The results show that at the investigated concentration La(3+) is hydrated by eight water molecules and one chloride ion, forming an inner-sphere ion complex in which the water molecules maintain angular configurations consistent with a tricapped trigonal prism configuration.

The three ionic liquids have the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anion paired with the tributylmethylammonium, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, and 1-decyl- 1-methylpyrrolidinium cations. The dynamics in the two-proline donor-bridge-acceptor complex are compared to those observed for the same donor and acceptor connected by a single proline bridge, studied previously by Lee, et al. (J. Phys. Chem. C 2012, 116, 5197). The increased conformational freedom afforded by the second bridging proline resulted in multiple energetically accessible conformations. The multiple conformations have significant variations in donor-acceptor electronic coupling, leading to dynamics that include both adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions. In common with the single-proline bridged complex, the intramolecular electron transfer in the two-proline system was found to be in Marcus inverted regime.},

abstract = {Previously we showed that CO2 could be used to extract organic molecules from ionic liquids without contamination of the ionic liquid. Consequently a number of other groups demonstrated that ionic liquid/CO2 biphasic systems could be used for homogeneously catalyzed reactions. Large differences in the solubility of various gases in ionic liquids present the possibility of using them for gas separations. More recently we and others have shown that the presence of CO2 increases the solubility of other gases that are poorly soluble in the ionic liquid phase. Therefore, a knowledge and understanding of the phase behavior of these ionic liquid/CO2 systems is important. With the aim of finding ionic liquids that improve CO2 solubility and gaining more information to help us understand how to design CO2-philic ionic liquids, we present the low- and high-pressure measurements of CO2 solubility in a range of ionic liquids possessing structures likely to increase the solubility of CO2. We examined the CO2 solubility in a number of ionic liquids with systematic increases in fluorination. We also studied nonfluorinated ionic liquids that have structural features known to improve CO2 solubility in other compounds such as polymers, for example, carbonyl groups and long alkyl chains with branching or ether linkages. Results show that ionic liquids containing increased fluoroalkyl chains on either the cation or anion do improve CO2 solubility when compared to less fluorinated ionic liquids previously studied. It was also found that it was possible to obtain similar, high levels of CO2 solubility in nonfluorous ionic liquids. In agreement with our previous results, we found that the anion frequently plays a key role in determining CO2 solubility in ionic liquids.},

Similarly, the frequency-frequency autocorrelation functions extracted from the time evolution of two-dimensional infrared spectra revealed a dynamical component having a picosecond time constant which is also not affected by the presence of high salt concentrations.

Accordingly, in electrochemical applications of these materials it is important to consider this reduction of the total charges on the ions, which can greatly affect the performance of the given process or device in which the ionic liquid is used. By slightly shifting from the salt-like to a molecular liquid-like system via the decreased charges, the charge transfer also fluidizes the ionic liquid. We believe that this vital information on the molecular level structure of ionic liquids offers a better understanding of these materials, and allows us to improve the a priori design of ionic liquids for any given purpose.},

abstract = {The conversion of solar energy to fuels in both natural and artificial photosynthesis requires components for both light-harvesting and catalysis. The light-harvesting component generates the electrochemical potentials required to drive fuel-generating reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically uphill. This Account focuses on work from our laboratories on developing molecular electrocatalysts for CO(2) reduction and for hydrogen production. A true analog of natural photosynthesis will require the ability to capture CO(2) from the atmosphere and reduce it to a useful fuel. Work in our laboratories has focused on both aspects of this problem. Organic compounds such as quinones and inorganic metal complexes can serve as redox-active CO(2) carriers for concentrating CO(2). We have developed catalysts for CO(2) reduction to form CO based on a [Pd(triphosphine)(solvent)](2+) platform. Catalytic activity requires the presence of a weakly coordinating solvent molecule that can dissociate during the catalytic cycle and provide a vacant coordination site for binding water and assisting C-O bond cleavage. Structures of [NiFe] CO dehydrogenase enzymes and the results of studies on complexes containing two [Pd(triphosphine)(solvent)](2+) units suggest that participation of a second metal in CO(2) binding may also be required for achieving very active catalysts. We also describe molecular electrocatalysts for H(2) production and oxidation based on [Ni(diphosphine)(2)](2+) complexes. Similar to palladium CO(2) reduction catalysts, these species require the optimization of both first and second coordination spheres. In this case, we use structural features of the first coordination sphere to optimize the hydride acceptor ability of nickel needed to achieve heterolytic cleavage of H(2). We use the second coordination sphere to incorporate pendant bases that assist in a number of important functions including H(2) binding, H(2) cleavage, and the transfer of protons between nickel and solution. These pendant bases, or proton relays, are likely to be important in the design of catalysts for a wide range of fuel production and fuel utilization reactions involving multiple electron and proton transfer steps. The generation of fuels from abundant substrates such as CO(2) and water remains a daunting research challenge, requiring significant advances in new inexpensive materials for light harvesting and the development of fast, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts. Although we describe progress in the development of redox-active carriers capable of concentrating CO(2) and molecular electrocatalysts for CO(2) reduction, hydrogen production, and hydrogen oxidation, much more remains to be done.},

abstract = {The structural, electronic, phonon dispersion and thermodynamic properties of MHCO(3) (M = Li, Na, K) solids were investigated using density functional theory. The calculated bulk properties for both their ambient and the high-pressure phases are in good agreement with available experimental measurements. Solid phase LiHCO(3) has not yet been observed experimentally. We have predicted several possible crystal structures for LiHCO(3) using crystallographic database searching and prototype electrostatic ground state modeling. Our total energy and phonon free energy (F(PH)) calculations predict that LiHCO(3) will be stable under suitable conditions of temperature and partial pressures of CO(2) and H(2)O. Our calculations indicate that the [Formula: see text] groups in LiHCO(3) and NaHCO(3) form an infinite chain structure through O⋯H⋯O hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the [Formula: see text] anions form dimers, [Formula: see text], connected through double hydrogen bonds in all phases of KHCO(3). Based on density functional perturbation theory, the Born effective charge tensor of each atom type was obtained for all phases of the bicarbonates. Their phonon dispersions with the longitudinal optical-transverse optical splitting were also investigated. Based on lattice phonon dynamics study, the infrared spectra and the thermodynamic properties of these bicarbonates were obtained. Over the temperature range 0-900 K, the F(PH) and the entropies (S) of MHCO(3) (M =Li, Na, K) systems vary as F(PH)(LiHCO(3)) > F(PH)(NaHCO(3)) > F(PH)(KHCO(3)) and S(KHCO(3)) > S(NaHCO(3)) > S(LiHCO(3)), respectively, in agreement with the available experimental data. Analysis of the predicted thermodynamics of the CO(2) capture reactions indicates that the carbonate/bicarbonate transition reactions for Na and K could be used for CO(2) capture technology, in agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {Water dynamics inside of reverse micelles made from the surfactant Aerosol-OT (AOT) were investigated by observing spectral diffusion, orientational relaxation, and population relaxation using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. The water pool sizes of the reverse micelles studied ranged in size from 5.8 to 1.7 nm in diameter. It is found that spectral diffusion, characterized by the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF), significantly changes as the water pool size decreases. For the larger reverse micelles (diameter 4.6 nm and larger), the 2D IR signal is composed of two spectral components: a signal from bulk-like core water, and a signal from water at the headgroup interface. Each of these signals (core water and interfacial water) is associated with a distinct FFCF. The FFCF of the interfacial water layer can be obtained using a modified center line slope (CLS) method that has been recently developed. The interfacial FFCFs for large reverse micelles have a single exponential decay (∼1.6 ps) to an offset plus a fast homogeneous component and are nearly identical for all large sizes. The observed ∼1.6 ps interfacial decay component is approximately the same as that found for bulk water and may reflect hydrogen bond rearrangement of bulk-like water molecules hydrogen bonded to the interfacial water molecules. The long time offset arises from dynamics that are too slow to be measured on the accessible experimental time scale. The influence of the chemical nature of the interface on spectral diffusion was explored by comparing data for water inside reverse micelles (5.8 nm water pool diameter) made from the surfactants AOT and Igepal CO-520. AOT has charged, sulfonate head groups, while Igepal CO-520 has neutral, hydroxyl head groups. It is found that spectral diffusion on the observable time scales is not overly sensitive to the chemical makeup of the interface. An intermediate-sized AOT reverse micelle (water pool diameter of 3.3 nm) is analyzed as a large reverse micelle because it has distinct core and interface regions, but its core region is more constrained than bulk water. The interfacial FFCF for this intermediate-sized reverse micelle is somewhat slower than those found for the larger reverse micelles. The water nanopools in the smaller reverse micelles cannot be separated into core and interface regions. In the small reverse micelles, the FFCFs are biexponential decays to an offset plus a fast homogeneous component. Each small reverse micelle exhibits an ∼1 ps decay time, which may arise from local hydrogen bond fluctuations and a slower, ∼6-10 ps decay, which is possibly due to slow hydrogen bond rearrangement of noninterfacial water molecules or topography fluctuations at the interface.},

abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been successfully applied to study the solubility of supercritical (sc) CO2 in an ionic liquid (IL), the swelling of the IL under scCO2, the diffusion of CO2 in the IL, and the molecular interaction between the IL and scCO2 using a single defined experimental setup. The study has been performed using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [bmim][PF6] and scCO2 with a pressure of up to 150 bar at 313 K. The solubility of scCO2 in the IL was calculated via the intensity of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode, which was measured using the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method. This approach allowed to determine also the swelling of the IL under scCO2 using several IL bands. The knowledge gained about the solubility and swelling allowed the calculation of the molar fraction of CO2 in the IL and the attainment of similar data as previously determined by other methods. The kinetic measurement of the infrared spectra also offered the opportunity to observe the evolution of the concentration of CO2 in the IL and allowed an estimation of the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in IL under high pressure. Finally, information about the molecular interactions between the IL and scCO2 could also be gained in situ using both infrared and Raman spectroscopy.},

The introduction of excess neutral imidazole to [Im][TFSI] leads to enhanced conductivity. We find that proton dynamics in [Im][TFSI] with excess imidazole are characterized by proton hopping that is encompassed in the slower of two translational processes, as identified by QENS. This relatively slow process contributes to long-range diffusion more than the faster process. NMR diffusion measurements show that proton hopping decreases with increasing temperature, but significant proton hopping persists even at the maximum experimental temperature of 120 °C. This, in combination with minimal ion aggregation, leads to high proton conductivity and a high proton transference number over a wide temperature range.},

abstract = {We have devised a kinetic lattice-gas model of an atomic liquid that incorporates the physical features associated with the formation of cages around a particle at high density. The model has simple equilibrium statistics, with a maximum of one particle per lattice site, and simple dynamical rules, so that it is feasible to perform dynamical calculations of the fluctuations about equilibrium over very long time scales. The cages inhibit the motion of the particles and cause the self-diffusion coefficient to fall rapidly with increasing density. Simulation results indicate that as the density $\rho$, defined as the number of particles per lattice site, approaches 0.881, the self-diffusion constant behaves in a critical way as (0.881-$\rho$)3.2. The time dependence of density-density correlation functions is calculated from the simulation results, and relaxation times extracted from these functions show a similar critical behavior. These results suggest that the model undergoes a dynamical transition from ergodic to nonergodic behavior. By investigating different system sizes we exclude the possibility that the observed transition is just a finite-size effect related to the bootstrap percolation problem. The mode-coupling theory (MCT) of ergodic-nonergodic transitions in the absence of activated hopping processes is tested for this model by comparing the behavior of the density correlation functions with the predictions of MCT. Surprisingly few of the MCT predictions hold for the system, depsite the fact that the model was devised to incorporate, in a schematic way, the dynamical cage effects that the MCT is usually regarded as describing. Thus the MCT does not provide a correct description of the cage-induced ideal-glass transition of this model.},

The correlation between the complex enthalpies of formation and dissociation rate constants can be expressed with an equation similar to the Arrhenius equation. The experimental results are in accord with previous observations on eight phenol/solvent complexes with enthalpies of formation from −0.6 to −2.5 kcal/mol. It was found that the inverse of the solute−solvent complex dissociation rate constant is linearly related to exp(−$\Delta$H0/RT) where $\Delta$H0 is the complex enthalpy of formation. It is shown here, that the triethylsilanol−solvent complexes obey the same relationship with the identical proportionality constant, that is, all 13 points, five silanol complexes and eight phenol complexes, fall on the same line. In addition, features of 2D IR chemical exchange spectra at long reaction times (spectral diffusion complete) are explicated using the triethylsilanol systems. It is shown that the off-diagonal chemical exchange peaks have shapes that are a combination (outer product) of the absorption line shapes of the species that give rise to the diagonal peaks.},

Although CO2 absorption was marginally affected by water at low H2O molar fractions for both ILs, an increase of the H2O content resulted in a marked enhancement of both the CO2 solubility (ca. 4-fold) and diffusivity (ca. 10-fold) in the binary [C(n)C1im][TCM]/H2O systems, in contrast to the weak and/or detrimental influence of water in most physically and chemically CO2-absorbing ILs. In-situ Raman spectroscopy on the IL/CO2 systems verified that CO2 is physically absorbed in the dry ILs with no significant effect on their structural organization. A pronounced variation of distinct tricyanomethanide Raman modes was disclosed in the [C(n)C1im][TCM]/H2O mixtures, attesting to the gradual disruption of the anion-cation coupling by the hydrogen-bonded water molecules to the [TCM](-) anions, in accordance with the positive excess molar volumes and negative viscosity deviations for the binary systems. Most importantly, CO2 absorption in the ILs/H2O mixtures at high water concentrations revealed that the [TCM](-) Raman modes tend to restore their original state for the heavily hydrated ILs, in qualitative agreement with the intriguing nonmonotonous transients of CO2 absorption kinetics unveiled by the gravimetric measurements for the hybrid solvents. A molecular exchange mechanism between CO2 in the gas phase and H2O in the liquid phase was thereby proposed to explain the enhanced CO2 absorption in the hybrid [C(n)C1im][TCM]//H2O solvents based on the subtle competition between the TCM-H2O and TCM-CO2 interactions, which renders these ILs very promising for CO2 separation applications.},

In general, all metals can lead to toxicity and oxidative stress when taken up in excessive amounts, imposing a serious threat to the environment and human health. In order to cope with different kinds of metals, plants possess defense strategies in which glutathione (GSH; $\gamma$-glu-cys-gly) plays a central role as chelating agent, antioxidant and signaling component. Therefore, this review highlights the role of GSH in: (1) metal homeostasis; (2) antioxidative defense; and (3) signal transduction under metal stress. The diverse functions of GSH originate from the sulfhydryl group in cysteine, enabling GSH to chelate metals and participate in redox cycling.},

We review the insights into metal specificity in cells provided by studies of ArsR-SmtB DNA binding, metal-responsive transcriptional repressors, and a bacterial copper chaperone. Cyanobacteria are the one bacterial group that have known enzymatic demand for cytoplasmic copper import. The copper chaperone and ATPases that supply cyanobacterial plastocyanin and cytochrome oxidase are reviewed, along with related ATPases for cobalt and zinc. These studies highlight the contributions of protein-protein interactions to metal speciation. Metal sensors and metallochaperones, along with metal transporters and metal-storage proteins, act in concert not only to supply the correct metals but also to withhold the wrong ones.},

abstract = {The stimulated infrared photon echo of N-methylacetamide-D [NMAD; CH3(CO)ND(CH3)] was measured and used to determine the vibrational frequency correlation function. The correlation function was modeled as a single exponential plus a constant, and it was found that most of the NMAD vibrational frequency distribution is motionally narrowed with a pure dephasing time of 1.12 ps. The two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectrum of NMAD was also obtained by heterodyning the echo field with a weak local oscillator pulse. The real and imaginary portions of the 2D IR spectrum exhibit multiple peaks due to upsilon = 0-1 and 1-2 coherences that are excited, which are not resolved in the absolute magnitude of the 2D IR spectrum. Using the correlation function determined from the stimulated photon echo, the 2D IR spectrum was accurately simulated. Resolution enhancement of the 2D IR spectrum was performed by manipulating the photon echo field with window functions. The enhanced experimental and simulated 2D IR spectra are dramatically narrowed. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

In a recent article [J. C. Araque et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 119(23), 7015-7029 (2015)], we explored large deviations from Stokes-Einstein translational diffusion caused by such a heterogeneity. The current article is set to explore the effect of soft and stiff solvent environments (i.e., structure) on OH-bond rotations in the case of water and small alcohols in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Im_{1,2}^+] [NTf_2-]). Is solute rotational dynamics heterogeneous? If so, are solute rotations and translations coupled in the sense that stiff and soft solvent environments hinder or speed up both types of dynamics? For the systems studied here, there appears to be a clear connection between translations, rotations, and stiff/soft solvent environments.We also discuss interesting asymmetries of the correlation between solutes with anions and cations.},

Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a very versatile ligand, forming stable complexes with both hard and soft metal ions. Several general binding modes of GSH are described. Soft metal ions coordinate exclusively or primarily through thiol sulfur. Hard ones prefer the amino acid-like moiety of the glutamic acid residue. Several transition metal ions can additionally coordinate to the peptide nitrogen of the gamma-Glu-Cys bond. Oxidized glutathione lacks the thiol function. Nevertheless, it proves to be a surprisingly efficient ligand for a range of metal ions, coordinating them primarily through the donors of the glutamic acid residue.},

A solid fraction enriched in cellulose was recovered, which was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Up to 90% of the glucose and 25% of the hemicellulose contained in the original biomass were released by the combined ionic liquid pretreatment and the enzymatic hydrolysis. After the pretreatment, the ionic liquid liquor contained the majority of the lignin and the hemicellulose. The lignin portion was partially precipitated from the liquor upon dilution with water. The amount of hemicellulose monomers in the ionic liquid liquor and their conversion into furfurals was also examined. The performance of ionic liquid-water mixtures containing 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids with acetate, methanesulfonate, trifluoromethanesulfonate and chloride anions was investigated. The applicability of the ionic liquid 1-butylimidazolium hydrogensulfate for lignocellulose pretreatment was also examined.

The results are compared with those for the same system in methanol and acetonitrile solution. Electron-transfer rates were measured using time-resolved fluorescence quenching for the donor− bridge−acceptor system comprising a 1-N,1-N-dimethylben- zene-1,4-diamine donor, a proline bridge, and a coumarin 343 acceptor. The photoinduced electron-transfer processes are in the inverted regime (−$\Delta$G > $\lambda$) in all four solvents, with driving forces of −1.6 to −1.9 eV and estimated reorganization energies of about 1.0 eV. The observed electron-transfer kinetics have broadly distributed rates that are generally slower in the ionic liquids compared to the neutral solvents, which also have narrower rate distributions. To describe the broad distributions of electron-transfer kinetics, we use two different models: a distribution of exponential lifetimes and a discrete sum of exponential lifetimes. Analysis of the donor−acceptor electronic coupling shows that for ionic liquids this intramolecular electron-transfer reaction should be treated using a solvent-controlled electron-transfer model.},

abstract = {The transport properties of 1,3-methylalkylimidazolium based ionic liquids are sensitive to their chemical structure. In this work, two key features of the chemical structure were investigated: the role of the anion and the length of the alkyl chain. Four different anions were examined for the 1,3-methylethylimidazolium salt (MeEtImX): bromide (Br−), iodide (I−), trifluoromethanesulfonate (Tf−) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (NTf2−) anions. Increasing the size of the anion resulted in a decrease of the melting point and a slight increase in the cation diffusion coefficient. The differences in cation diffusion behaviour reflect the differences in viscosity, with much higher viscosities expected for the halide salts. In contrast to this diffusion behaviour, the melt conductivities are all very similar. The inconsistency between the calculated conductivity (based on diffusion measurements) and the conductivity measured, however, is attributed to correlated ion motions and/or the diffusion of neutral species that do not contribute to the conductivity. The effect of the length of the alkyl substituent was also studied for 1,3-methylalkylimidazolium iodide (MeRImI). Increasing the length of the alkyl chain, from methyl to a linear heptyl chain, suppresses the melting point and decreases both the conductivity and cation diffusion coefficients. In this case, the viscosity, as well as the size of the cation, influence ion transport in these materials.},

abstract = {Energy-filtered Analytical Electron Microscopy (AEM) was used to image the ultrastructure and determine quantitatively the chemical composition of rat melanosomes of the choroid and the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). For the first time, the effect of staining in elemental analysis of melanosomes was investigated. Detection limits and accuracies of the applied methods were determined. Compared to previous work applying only quantitative Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) in the TEM (Eibl, O., et al., 2006. Micron 37, 262), here we present a combined quantitative EDX and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, including N. This yields the fraction of eumelanin and pheomelanin in melanosomes by the S/N mole fraction ratio. Melanosomes of the sepia ink sac, used as eumelanin standard, showed an S/N mole fraction ratio of <0.004. Thus, they consist primarily of eumelanin as reported by degradation analysis. In contrast, melanosomes of the rats contained mixed melanin with significant amounts of pheomelanin (S/N 0.02) in the RPE and the choroid. Consistent with the previous publication, it was shown that oxygen mole fractions are especially large in melanosomes (7-10 at.%) compared to other cell compartments, e.g. 2-4 at.% oxygen in the cytoplasm. In the melanosomes of non-stained tissue, the oxygen mole fraction clearly correlated with the Ca mole fraction. EDX spectra used for quantitative analysis had about 15,000 net counts under the oxygen peak, which is necessary to obtain (i) a small statistical error for oxygen and (ii) optimum minimum detectable mole fractions for S, Ca and transition metals. The precise determination of the oxygen mole fraction in melanosomes is important for understanding metabolism. Therefore, a detailed analysis was carried out on the possible errors affecting quantification. While O, S, and N mole fractions yielded similar results in stained and non-stained ocular melanosomes of rats, transition metals can only be determined reliably in non-stained tissues. High-precision EDX analysis of melanosomes yielded minimum detectable mole fractions of less than 0.04 at.% for Cu and Zn, these elements were present in melanosomes with mole fractions of about 0.3 at.% and 0.1at.%, respectively. Zn is of great importance for metabolism and for age related macular degeneration. Its mole fraction in melanosomes of rats is large enough to be detected and to be quantitatively analyzed by EDX spectroscopy. Ultrastructural information can now be correlated to the elemental composition. This is important to better understand the physical and chemical properties of melanosomal metabolism and turnover.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are salts that are liquid near ambient conditions. Interest in these unusual compounds has exploded in the last decade, both at the academic and commercial level. Molecular simulations based on classical potentials have played an important role in helping researchers understand how condensed phase properties of these materials are linked to chemical structure and composition. Simulations have also predicted many properties and unexpected phenomena that have subsequently been confirmed experimentally. The beneficial impact molecular simulations have had on this field is due in large part to excellent timing. Just when computing power and simulation methods matured to the point where complex fluids could be studied in great detail, a new class of materials virtually unknown to experimentalists came on the scene and demanded attention. This topical review explores some of the history of ionic liquid molecular simulations, and then gives examples of the recent use of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation in understanding the structure of ionic liquids, the sorption of small molecules in ionic liquids, the nature of ionic liquids in the vapor phase and the dynamics of ionic liquids. This review concludes with a discussion of some of the outstanding problems facing the ionic liquid modeling community and how condensed phase molecular simulation experts not presently working on ionic liquids might help advance the field.},

abstract = {Vibrational echo correlation spectroscopy experiments on the OD stretch of dilute HOD in H2OH2O are used to probe the structural dynamics of water. A method is demonstrated for combining correlation spectra taken with different infrared pulse bandwidths (pulse durations), making it possible to use data collected from many experiments in which the laser pulse properties are not identical. Accurate measurements of the OD stretch anharmonicity (162 cm−1) are presented and used in the data analysis. In addition, the recent accurate determination of the OD vibrational lifetime (1.45 ps) and the time scale for the production of vibrational relaxation induced broken hydrogen bond “photoproducts” (∼2 ps) aid in the data analysis. The data are analyzed using time dependent diagrammatic perturbation theory to obtain the frequency time correlation function (FTCF). The results are an improved FTCF compared to that obtained previously with vibrational echo correlation spectroscopy. The experimental data and the experimentally determined FTCF are compared to calculations that employ a polarizable water model (SPC-FQ) to calculate the FTCF. The SPC-FQ derived FTCF is much closer to the experimental results than previously tested nonpolarizable water models which are also presented for comparison.},

abstract = {Interfacial water in close proximity to an adsorbed surfactant layer plays an important role in many areas. Here, we systematically investigate the interfacial water structure at the adsorption layer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) from low concentrations to its critical micelle concentration. Our sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy results show that, with increasing CTAB concentration, the water SFG signals first increase, reaching maximum intensities at 0.1 mM, and then drop, whereas the ppp SFG signals of the terminal-methyl asymmetric stretch reach maximum intensities and saturate at 1 mM, which is the critical micelle concentration of CTAB. Our analysis reveals that the interfacial water layer adopts the most orderly arrangement when the interfacial potential of the adsorption layer reaches saturation and not at the surfactant concentration of adsorption saturation. Most importantly, our SFG data provide direct evidence for the antagonistic effects of the interfacial potential and thickness compression of the electrostatic field of the surfactant adsorption layer, leading to the strongest water SFG signals at 0.1 mM. Below 0.1 mM, the increased interfacial potential can have a pronounced effect on the increase of the overall dipole moment of the interfacial water layers. Above 0.1 mM, the decreased Debye screening length significantly reduces the water dipole moment. Finally, the newly proposed adsorption model cannot explain our SFG results.},

Here, we use femtosecond IR spectroscopy to elucidate the local structural dynamics in protic alkylammonium-based ionic liquids. The structural relaxation after an ultrafast temperature increase, following vibrational excitation and subsequent relaxation of the N-D (or N-H) stretching vibration, is found to vary substantially between the ionic and hydrophobic subdomains. The dynamics in the ionic domains are virtually unaffected by the alkyl chain length and is, therefore, decoupled from viscosity. Equilibration within the hydrophobic subdomains, as evident from the dynamics of the C-H stretching vibration, is faster than that in the ionic domains and shows a remarkably low thermal activation.},

abstract = {A selected multireference configuration interaction (CI) method and the corresponding code are presented. It is based on a procedure of localization that permits to obtain well localized occupied and virtual orbitals. Due to the local character of the electron correlation, using local orbitals allows one to neglect long range interactions. In a first step, three topological matrices are constructed, which determine whether two orbitals must be considered as interacting or not. Two of them concern the truncation of the determinant basis, one for occupied/virtual, the second one for dispersive interactions. The third one concerns the truncation of the list of two electron integrals. This approach permits a fine analysis of each kind of approximation and induces a huge reduction of the CI size and of the computational time. The procedure is tested on linear polyene aldehyde chains, dissociation potential energy curve, and reaction energy of a pesticide-Ca(2+) complex and finally on transition energies of a large iron system presenting a light-induced excited spin-state trapping effect.},

These solvents are model systems commonly used to assess anesthetic potency. Picosecond time-scale molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that protein dynamics or membrane dynamics play a role in the molecular mechanism of anesthetic action. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy with 100 fs time resolution is an ideal tool to probe dynamics of anesthetic molecules on such timescales. Pump-probe studies at the peak of the vibrational band yield a lifetime of $55 \pm 1$ ps in olive oil and $52 \pm 1 ps$ in octanol. The similarity of lifetimes suggests that energy relaxation of the anesthetic is determined primarily by the hydrophobic nature of the environment, consistent with models of anesthetic action. The results show that nitrous oxide is a good model system for probing anesthetic-solvent interactions using nonlinear infrared spectroscopy.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse the electronic properties of gas-phase 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium Cl ion pairs, [C(4)C(1)im]Cl, in order to deepen our understanding of ionic liquids in general. Examination of charge densities, natural bond orbitals (NBO), and delocalised molecular orbitals computed at the B3LYP and MP2/6-31(++)G(d,p) levels have enabled us to explain a number of experimental phenomena: the relative acidity of different sites on the imidazolium ring, variations in hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor abilities, the apparent contradiction of the hydrogen-bond-donor parameters for different types of solute, the low probability of finding a Cl(-) anion at the rear of the imidazolium ring and the expansion of the imidazolium ring in the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor. The unreactive but coordinating environment and large electrochemical window have also been accounted for, as has the strong electron-donating character of the carbon atoms to the rear of the ring in associated imidazolylidenes. The electronic structure of the [C(4)C(1)im](+) cation is best described by a C(4)==C(5) double bond at the rear, and a delocalised three-centre 4 e(-) component across the front (N(1)-C(2)-N(3)) of the imidazolium ring; delocalisation between these regions is also significant. Hydrogen-bond formation is driven by Coulombic stabilisation, which compensates for an associated destabilisation of the electronic part of the system. Interactions are dominated by a large positive charge at C(2) and the build up of pi-electron density above and below the ring, particularly that associated with the double bond between C(4) and C(5). The NBO partial charges have been computed and compared with those used in a number of classical simulations.},

X-ray diffraction studies show that 2 is square planar, while the other complexes possess tris-chelated distorted-octahedral geometries. All of the complexes are active catalysts for both the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic production of hydrogen in 1/1 EtOH/H2O. When coupled with fluorescein (Fl) as the photosensitizer (PS) and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial electron donor, these complexes exhibit activity for light-driven hydrogen generation that correlates with ligand electron donor ability. Complex 4c achieves over 7300 turnovers of H2 in 30 h, which is among the highest reported for a molecular noble metal-free system. The initial photochemical step is reductive quenching of Fl* by TEA because of the latter's greater concentration. When system concentrations are modified so that oxidative quenching of Fl* by catalyst becomes more dominant, system durability increases, with a system lifetime of over 60 h. System variations and cyclic voltammetry experiments are consistent with a CECE mechanism that is common to electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production. This mechanism involves initial protonation of the catalyst followed by reduction and then additional protonation and reduction steps to give a key Ni-H(-)/N-H(+) intermediate that forms the H-H bond in the turnover-limiting step of the catalytic cycle. A key to the activity of these catalysts is the reversible dechelation and protonation of the pyridine N atoms, which enable an internal heterocoupling of a metal hydride and an N-bound proton to produce H2.},

In both solvents, the relaxation of the 3 = 1 state of the anion leads to a direct recovery of the vibrational ground state and involves the resonant transfer of the excess vibrational energy onto the solvent. In light water, the energy-accepting states are provided by the bending-librational combination band (b + L), while in heavy water, the relaxation is thermally assisted by virtual acceptor states derived from the stretching-librational/restricted translational hot band (S - L,T). The relaxation rate is found to strictly obey Fermi"s Golden Rule when the density of resonant solvent states is estimated from the linear infrared spectra of the solute and the pure solvents.},

Exploiting this potential requires a fundamental understanding of the mixing behavior of ILs.

Upon mixing the ILs, significant changes in the anion IR bands are induced, indicating mixing at the molecular level for highly symmetric anions. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show water to be a suitable probe molecule: IR bands of anion-1{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H?O?H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}anion-2, anion-1{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H?O?H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}anion-1, and anion-2{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H?O?H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}anion-2 are well suitable for inspection and quantification of the coexistence of each type of cluster.

High porosity was maintained despite stoichiometric attachment of mmen to the open metal sites of the framework, resulting in a BET surface area of 870 m2 g-1. At 25 °C under a 0.15 bar CO2/0.75 bar N2 mixture, mmen-CuBTTri adsorbs 2.38 mmol CO2 g-1 (9.5 wt%) with a selectivity of 327, as determined using Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST). The high capacity and selectivity are consequences of the exceptionally large isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, calculated to be -96 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage. Infrared spectra support chemisorption between amines and CO2 as one of the primary mechanisms of uptake. Despite the large initial heat of adsorption, the CO2 uptake was fully reversible and the framework could be easily regenerated at 60 °C, enabling a cycling time of just 27 min with no loss of capacity over the course of 72 adsorption/desorption cycles. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The recycling or sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the waste gas of fossil-fuel power plants is widely acknowledged as one of the most realistic strategies for delaying or avoiding the severest environmental, economic, political, and social consequences that will result from global climate change and ocean acidification. For context, in 2013 coal and natural gas power plants accounted for roughly 31% of total U.S. CO 2 emissions. Recycling or sequestering this CO 2 would reduce U.S. emissions by ca. 1800 million metric tonseasily meeting the U.S.'s currently stated CO 2 reduction targets of ca. 17% relative to 2005 levels by 2020. This situation is similar for many developed and developing nations, many of which officially target a 20% reduction relative to 1990 baseline levels by 2020. To make CO 2 recycling or sequestration processes technologically and economically viable, the CO 2 must first be separated from the rest of the waste gas mixturewhich is comprised mostly of nitrogen gas and water (ca. 85%). Of the many potential separation technologies available, membrane technology is particularly attractive due to its low energy operating cost, low maintenance, smaller equipment footprint, and relatively facile retrofit integration with existing power plant designs. From a techno-economic standpoint, the separation of CO 2 from flue gas requires membranes that can process extremely high amounts of CO 2 over a short time period, a property defined as the membrane " permeance " . In contrast, the membrane's CO 2 /N 2 selectivity has only a minor effect on the overall cost of some separation processes once a threshold permeability selectivity of ca. 20 is reached. Given the above criteria, the critical properties when developing membrane materials for postcombustion CO 2 separation are CO 2 permeability (i.e., the rate of CO 2 transport normalized to the material thickness), a reasonable CO 2 /N 2 selectivity (≥20), and the ability to be processed into defect-free thin-films (ca. 100-nm-thick active layer). Traditional polymeric membrane materials are limited by a trade-off between permeability and selectivity empirically described by the " Robeson upper bound "  placing the desired membrane properties beyond reach. Therefore, the investigation of advanced and composite materials that can overcome the limitations of traditional polymeric materials is the focus of significant academic and industrial research. In particular, there has been substantial work on ionic-liquid (IL)-based materials due to their gas transport properties. This review provides an overview of our collaborative work on developing poly(ionic liquid)/ionic liquid (PIL/IL) ion-gel membrane technology. We detail developmental work on the preparation of PIL/IL composites and describe how this chemical technology was adapted to allow the roll-to-roll processing and preparation of membranes with defect-free active layers ca. 100 nm thick, CO 2 permeances of over 6000 GPU, and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of ≥20properties with the potential to reduce the cost of CO 2 removal from coal-fired power plant flue gas to ca. $15 per ton of CO 2 captured. Additionally, we examine the materials developments that have produced advanced PIL/IL composite membranes. These advancements include cross-linked PIL/IL blends, step-growth PIL/IL networks with facilitated transport groups, and PIL/IL composites with microporous additives for CO 2 /CH 4 separations.},

Broadband ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy and transient absorption are used to measure vibrational relaxation, spectral diffusion, and orientational relaxation dynamics. The hydrated proton bend displays fast vibrational relaxation and spectral diffusion timescales of 200-300 fs; however, the transient absorption anisotropy decays on a remarkably long 2.5 ps timescale, which matches the timescale for hydrogen bond reorganization in liquid water.

At low CS(2) concentrations (<10 mol.% CS(2)/IL), the MD simulations indicate that the CS(2) molecules are localized in the nonpolar domains. In contrast, at higher concentrations (≥10 mol.% CS(2)/IL), the MD simulations show aggregation of the CS(2) molecules. The optical Kerr effect (OKE) spectra of the mixtures are interpreted in terms of an additivity model with the components arising from the subpicosecond dynamics of CS(2) and the IL. Comparison of the CS(2)-component with the OKE spectra of CS(2) in alkane solvents is consistent with CS(2) mainly being localized in the nonpolar domains, even at high CS(2) concentrations, and the local CS(2) concentration being higher than the bulk CS(2) concentration.},

This unique property has overcome a major problem with IL-based facilitated transport membranes (FTMs), namely the low CO2 diffusivity caused by the extremely high liquid viscosity. This problem is especially severe at low temperature. In our preliminary experiments, the AHA IL tetrabutylphosphonium 2-cyanopyrrolide ([P4444][2-CNpyrr]) was studied in a FTM and it exhibited good CO2 permeability and CO2/N2} selectivity. [P4444][2-CNpyrr] does not react as strongly with CO2 as other reactive ILs, however, and its viscosity is still somewhat high. The \ce{CO2} separation performance of an IL-based FTM is expected to be better if a lower viscosity IL is used that binds CO2 more strongly. In this work, several AHA ILs were studied and their CO2 reactivity and viscosity were calculated using molecular simulation. The IL triethyl(methoxymethyl)phosphonium pyrrolide ([P222(1o1)][pyrr]) was predicted to have the highest reactivity and the lowest viscosity of the investigated AHA ILs, suggesting that its use in a FTM will lead to much higherCO2 permeability than previously reported IL-FTM systems such as [P4444][2-CNpyrr]).},

abstract = {A combined electronic structure/molecular dynamics approach was used to calculate infrared and isotropic Raman spectra for the OH or OD stretches of dilute HOD in D2O or H2O, respectively. The quantities needed to compute the infrared and Raman spectra were obtained from density functional theory calculations performed on clusters, generated from liquid-state configurations, containing an HOD molecule along with 4-9 solvent water molecules. The frequency, transition dipole, and isotropic transition polarizability were each empirically related to the electric field due to the solvent along the OH (or OD) bond, calculated on the H (or D) atom of interest. The frequency and transition dipole moment of the OH (or OD) stretch of the HOD molecule were found to be very sensitive to its instantaneous solvent environment, as opposed to the isotropic transition polarizability, which was found to be relatively insensitive to environment. Infrared and isotropic Raman spectra were computed within a molecular dynamics simulation by using the empirical relationships and semiclassical expressions for the line shapes. The line shapes agree well with experiment over a temperature range from 10 to 90 degrees C.},

abstract = {The theory of fluorescent emission anisotropy [r(t)] of a cylindrical probe in a membrane suspension is developed. It is shown, independent of any model, that the limiting anisotropy [r(infinity)] is proportional to the square to the order parameter of the probe. The order parameter determines the first nontrivial term in the expansion of the equilibrium orientational distribution function of the probe in a series of Legendre polynomials. Following Kinosita, Kawato, and Ikegami, the motion of the probe is described as diffusion ("wobbling") within a cone of semiangle theta 0. Within the framework of this model, an accurate single-exponential approximation for r(t) is considered. An analytic expression relating the effective relaxation time, which appears in the above approximation, to theta 0 and the diffusion coefficient for wobbling is derived. The model is generalized to the situation where the probe is attached to a macromolecule whose motion cannot be neglected on the time scale of the fluorescence experiment. Finally, by exploiting the formal similarity between the theory of fluorescence depolarization and 13C-NMR dipolar relaxation, expressions for T1, T2, and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement are derived for a protonated carbon which is nonrigidly attached to a macromolecule and undergoes librational motion described as diffusion on a spherical "cap" of semiangle theta 0.},

abstract = {This paper presents several experimentally collected tensor elements of the direct fifth-order Raman signal of room temperature CS2.CS2. All results were collected so as to reduce contamination from third-order cascade signals, and it is shown that while these cascade signals are of varying importance in different tensor elements, phase matching considerations are sufficient to make the direct fifth-order signal the dominant signal in every tensor element collected. We show, as predicted, that the different tensor elements appear to weight particular Liouville pathways of the direct fifth-order signal, and thus particular dynamics of the studied system, differently. The magic angle signals are shown to contain information about the intermolecular vibrational echo and to put a limit on the time scale of rephasing of the room temperature liquid. The RyzzzzyRyzzzzy tensor element, in conjunction with the RyyzzzzRyyzzzz tensor element, is shown to be useful in studying the pure dephasing and population dynamics of the liquid. From these data it appears that population dynamics occur on a much longer time scale than pure dephasing dynamics, even though this is not obvious for the intermolecular motions of a room temperature liquid that are studied here. Further, intensities and behaviors of different tensor elements of the experimental data are compared with the only detailed theory currently available that explicitly includes polarization dependence.},

abstract = {Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of polyatomic, as opposed to diatomic, molecules can occur via different, often solvent assisted, intramolecular and/or intermolecular pathways. In this paper, we apply the linearized semiclassical (LSC) method for calculating VER rates in the prototypical case of a rigid, symmetrical and linear triatomic molecule (A-B-A) in a monatomic liquid. Starting at the first excited state of either the symmetric or asymmetric stretches, VER can occur either directly to the ground state or indirectly via intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR). The VER rate constants for the various pathways are calculated within the framework of the Landau-Teller formalism, where they are expressed in terms of two-time quantum-mechanical correlation functions. The latter are calculated by the LHA-LSC method, which puts them in a "Wignerized" form, and employs a local harmonic approximation (LHA) in order to compute the necessary multidimensional Wigner integrals. Results are reported for the LHL/Ar model of Deng and Stratt [J. Chem. Phys. 2002, 117, 1735], as well as for CO 2 in liquid argon and in liquid neon. The LHA-LSC method is shown to give rise to significantly faster VER and IVR rates in comparison to the classical treatment, particularly at lower temperatures. We also find that the type and extent of the quantum rate enhancement is strongly dependent on the particular VER pathway. Finally, we find that the classical and semiclassical treatments can give rise to opposite trends when it comes to the dependence of the VER rates on the solvent. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) represent a fascinating, and yet to be fully understood, medium for a variety of chemical, physical and biological processes. Electrochemical processes form an important subset of these that are particularly of interest, since ILs tend to be good electrochemical solvents and exhibit other properties which make them very useful as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. It is important therefore to understand the extent to which electrochemical reactions and processes behave in a relatively ‘‘normal'', for example aqueous solution, fashion as opposed to exhibiting phenomena more uniquely the product of their organic ionic nature.

abstract = {We report on the orientational dynamics of water at an extended hydrophobic interface with an octadecylsilane self-assembled monolayer on fused silica. The interfacial dangling OH stretch mode is excited with a resonant pump, and its evolution followed in time by a surface-specific, vibrationally resonant, infrared-visible sum-frequency probe. High sensitivity pump-probe anisotropy measurements and isotopic dilution clearly reveal that the decay of the dangling OH stretch excitation is almost entirely due to a jump to a hydrogen-bonded configuration that occurs in 1.61 ± 0.10 ps. This is more than twice as fast as the jump time from one hydrogen-bonded configuration to another in bulk H2O but about 50% slower than the reported out-of-plane reorientation at the air/water interface. In contrast, the intrinsic population lifetime of the dangling OH stretch in the absence of such jumps is found to be >10 ps. Molecular dynamics simulations of air/water and hexane/water interfaces reproduce the fast jump dynamics of interfacial dangling OH with calculated jump times of 1.4 and 1.7 ps for the air and hydrophobic interfaces, respectively. The simulations highlight that while the air/water and hydrophobic/water surfaces exhibit great structural similarities, a small stabilization of the OH groups by the hydrophobic interface produces the pronounced difference in the dynamics of dangling bonds.},

Comparisons are made between the ytterbium-based technology and titanium sapphire laser systems for time-resolved IR spectroscopy measurements. The 100 kHz probing system provides new capability in time-resolved multiple-probe experiments, as more information is obtained from samples in a single experiment through multiple-probing. This method uses the high repetition-rate probe pulses to repeatedly measure spectra at 10 $\mu$s intervals following excitation allowing extended timescales to be measured routinely along with ultrafast data. Results are presented showing the measurement of molecular dynamics over >10 orders of magnitude in timescale, out to 20 ms, with an experimental time response of <200 fs. The power of multiple-probing is explored through principal component analysis of repeating probe measurements as a novel method for removing noise and measurement artifacts.},

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO(2) emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%. This Review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO(2) emissions to the atmosphere, namely postcombustion (predominantly CO(2)/N(2) separation), precombustion (CO(2)/H(2)) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO(2)/CH(4)). The key factor which underlies significant advancements lies in improved materials that perform the separations. In this regard, the most recent developments and emerging concepts in CO(2) separations by solvent absorption, chemical and physical adsorption, and membranes, amongst others, will be discussed, with particular attention on progress in the burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks.},

Here, we report on the direct observation and quantification of the coupling between intermolecular and intramolecular coordinates using two-dimensional, ultra-broadband, terahertz-infrared-visible (2D TIRV) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics calculations. Our study reveals strong coupling of the O-H stretch vibration, independent of the degree of delocalization of this high-frequency mode, to low-frequency intermolecular motions over a wide frequency range from 50 to 250 cm−1, corresponding to both the intermolecular hydrogen bond bending (≈ 60 cm−1) and stretching (≈ 180 cm−1) modes. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the coupling of the O-H stretch vibration to collective, delocalized intermolecular modes.},

The set of five cyano anion ILs studied comprises the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation paired with each of these five anions: selenocyanate, thiocyanate, dicyanamide, tricyanomethanide, and tetracyanoborate. Measurements with these anions dilute in acetonitrile and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide show that the selenocyanate and tricyanomethanide anions are strong quenchers of the 9,10-DCNA fluorescence, thiocyanate is a moderately strong quencher, dicyanamide is a weak quencher, and no quenching is observed for tetracyanoborate. Quenching rates are obtained from both time-resolved fluorescence transients and time-integrated spectra. Application of a Smoluchowski diffusion-and-reaction model showed that the complex kinetics observed can be fit using only two adjustable parameters, D and V0, where D is the relative diffusion coefficient between donor and acceptor and V0 is the value of the electronic coupling at donor–acceptor contact.},

This difference in lifetime allows for a clear separation of the response of the solvation shell from that of the bulk liquid. We observe that the solvating HDO molecules show much slower hydrogen-bond and reorientation dynamics than bulk water molecules. In contrast, the dynamics of the water molecules outside the first ionic hydration shell are observed to be negligibly affected by the ions.},

abstract = {Dynamics of supercooled ortho-terphenyl, salol, benzophenone, 2-biphenylmethanol, and dibutylphthalate have been studied using optical heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect experiments over a broad range of time, <1 ps to tens of ns. On time scales longer than those influenced by intramolecular vibrational dynamics, “intermediate” power law decays with temperature independent exponents close to −1 have been observed from ∼2 ps to 1–10 ns in all five samples. The intermediate power law decays occur over a wide range of temperatures from well above to somewhat below Tc,Tc, the mode-coupling theory (MCT) critical temperature. The intermediate power law corresponds to approximately a logarithmic decay of the polarizability–polarizability (orientational) correlation function. The amplitude of the intermediate power law increases with increasing temperature as [(T−Tc)/Tc]1/2.[(T−Tc)/Tc]1/2. The intermediate power law decay is followed by a second longer time scale power law, and the final portion of the decay is exponential. As a framework for discussion, the results are compared to the quantitative predictions of the MCT. The observations are in contrast to the standard MCT for the longer time portions of the decays. The observed intermediate power law decays may be consistent with MCT if the dynamics occur in the part of the MCT parameter space near a high order singularity (end point case).},

Flash photolysis experiments demonstrated photocycle yields of the long-lived 'pB' signalling state of PYP of up to 10% with pulse durations of 130, 500 and 850 fs at 450 nm wavelength. The power density dependence of the transient pB concentration depends strongly on the pulse duration primarily because photobleaching is prominent at the GW/mm2level.},

abstract = {The hydrolysis of sodium borohydride in aqueous buffer solutions at 26" is catalyzed by general acids. The Bronsted constant is nearly 0.9. Salt effects and solvent isotope effects have been measured. A mechanism involving a rate-de- termining proton transfer from a general acid onto the borohydride ion is consistent with the data of numerous investigators. One reactive intermediate has been trapped by hydrolyzing sodium borohydride in aqueous trimethylamine. Trimethyl- amine borane was produced in 1.45 f 0.09% yield while the remainder of the borohydride gave hydrogen gas. Hydrolysis of sodium borodeuteride occurs faster than the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. The primary inverse isotope effect, kH/kD, is 0.170 z!= 0.02 at 25". The isotope effect for the boron-hydrogen bond has been calculated using the method of Bigel- eisen and Wolfsberg. Several likely models of the activated complex give values of kR/kD from 0.60 to 0.95. A simplified model predicts 0.65 if the amount of primary bond breaking is proportional to the amount of secondary bond stiffening. The possible role of steric effects on secondary hydrogen isotope effects has been estimated on a static model. The results show that both normal and inverse secondary isotope effects can be explained in this manner. Introduction},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to investigate nanostructural organization in mixtures of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ionic liquid and water at multiple water concentrations. Evolution of the polar network, water network, and micelle structures is visualized and analyzed via partial radial distribution functions. The calculated static partial structure factors show that within the range of water contents examined, polar networks, water networks, and micelles possess an approximately invariant characteristic length at around 20 A. Furthermore, the above calculations point out that, as the amount of water increases, the polar network is continuously broken up (screened) by the intruding water, while the structural organization of the water network and the micelle exhibits a turnover. At the turnover point, the most ordered micelle (cation-cation) structure and water (water-anion-water) network are formed. Thereafter, the structural organization abates drastically, and only loose micelle structure exists due to the dominant water-water interactions. The simulated turnover of structural organization agrees with the sharpest peak in the experimentally obtained structure factor in aqueous solutions of similar ionic liquids; the simulated water structure reveals that water can form liquidlike associated aggregates due to the planar symmetry and strong basicity of NO(3)-, in agreement with experiment. The turnover of structural organization of micelles results from the persistent competition between the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar groups and the breakup of the charged polar network with increasing water content, whereas the turnover of the water network results from the competition between the water-water and water-anion interactions.},

abstract = {Today, all the existing coal-fired power plants present over the world emit about 2 billion tons of CO2 per year. The identification of a capture process which would fit the needs of target separation performances, together with a minimal energy penalty, is a key issue. Because of their fundamental engineering and economic advantages over competing separation technologies, membrane operations are, now, being explored for CO2 capture from power plant emissions.The aim of this work is to provide people interested in the use of membranes in CO2 capture a general overview of the actual situation both in terms of materials studies and global strategy to follow in the choice of the membrane gas separation with respect to the other separation technologies. Firstly, an overview on the polymeric membranes currently studied for their use in CO2 capture and of their transport properties is proposed. Up to now, the most promising materials developed at laboratory scale show a selectivity of 100-160. Then, some important design parameters have been introduced in order to evaluate the advantages potentially offered by membrane systems with respect to the other separation technologies (adsorption and cryogenic). These parameters, based on specific considerations related to the output to be obtained as the product purity and the final destination of the product and to the feed conditions, might constitute guidelines for the choice of the separation technology.Considering as case study a flue gas stream containing 13% of CO2, some general maps of CO2 recovery versus permeate purity have been introduced. This might constitute a simple tool useful for an immediate and preliminary analysis on the membrane technology suitability for CO2 separation from flue gas, also on the light of specific considerations, strictly related to the output to be obtained. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The protonation state of ionizable residues is an important contributor to protein stability and function. Histidine is of particular importance because its side chain pK(a) is near physiological pH. The sensitivity of carbon deuterium (C-D) vibrational frequencies to the protonation state of histidine dipeptide (Hdp) was investigated in the gas-phase using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in aqueous solution using two-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics (ONIOM) calculations. All three C-D vibrational probes on the side chain (C(beta)-D(2), C(delta)-D, and C(epsilon)-D) independently exhibited a striking sensitivity to the gas-phase histidine protonation state, with calculated shifts of up to 40 cm(-1) upon deprotonation of the histidine residue. Simultaneously including all three C-D vibrational probes on the Hdp side chain produced significant shifts of 28 to 43 cm(-1) between the neutral and charged states. The calculated intensities also dropped precipitously upon deprotonation, which is an important factor for the interpretation of experiments employing C-D vibrational probes to investigate side chain protonation. Solvating the labeled Hdp molecule produces an overall blue-shift in the average C-D vibrational frequencies relative to the gas-phase. The C(beta)-D(2), C(delta)-D, and C(epsilon)-D vibrational probes all showed sensitivity to the histidine protonation state, with shifts of up to 40 cm(-1) in the mean frequencies after deprotonation, which bodes well for studies employing C-D probes to study histidine protonation state in peptides and proteins.},

Although it has been widely acknowledged that the unique features of ILs originate from their dual ionic and organic nature, its microscopic physical origin still remains blurry. In this work, by comparing the ion/molecule cage structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations for seven prototypic liquids-a molten inorganic salt, four ILs, a strongly polar organic solvent, and a weakly polar organic solvent, we have revealed that the depth of the cage energy landscape characterizes the ionic nature of ILs, whereas the slope and curvature of its mimimum determine the organic nature of ILs. This finding advances our understanding of ILs and thus will help their efficient utilization as well as the systematic design of novel functionalized ILs.},

abstract = {Poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) is miscible with CO2over a broad range of molecular weights at 298 K. The cloud-point pressures needed to dissolve ∼ 5 wt% poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) at 298 K are significantly greater than those needed to dissolve PVAc, even though a PMA repeat group has the same number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms as in PVAc. This large difference in dissolution pressures is attributed to the lack of accessibility of the carbon dioxide to the carbonyl group in PMA. In addition, experimental data for poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) copolymers with readily accessible side groups suggest that an acetate group is slightly more CO2-philic than an acrylate group. PVAc is more CO2-soluble than other hydrocarbon homopolymers, including poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(lactide) (PLA). However, PoVAc is significantly less miscible with CO2than PDMS and poly (fluoroalkyl acrylate) (PFA). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A type of beat in nonlinear optical spectroscopy that is distinct from quantum beats $\sim$QB's! and polarization beats, is described. Like a quantum beat, this beat, which we refer to as an accidental degeneracy beat $\sim$ADB!, can only be seen in multilevel systems. However, unlike quantum beats, which are the result of intramolecular interferences, ADB's are interferences between different subensembles of molecules in the sample. They require multilevel systems with spectral overlap. ADB's can appear as separate frequencies or as phase and amplitude contributions with the same frequency as that of quantum beats. A procedure for distinguishing between quantum beats and ADB's is outlined, and criteria under which ADB's are expected to be observed are delineated. Calculations of the spectrally resolved stimulated vibrational echo signal from an inhomogeneously broadened coupled anharmonic oscillator system are presented to illustrate the differences between the two types of beats. ADB's carry information about the anharmonicity of a system, while QB's carry information about intramolecular correspondence of transition frequencies in a multilevel system.},

Similarly, ionic liquids are increasingly popular anhydrous reaction media for a number of industrial processes. Consequently, the use of enzymes in ionic liquids as efficient, environment-friendly, commercial biocatalysts is highly attractive. However, issues surrounding the poor solubility and low stability of enzymes in truly anhydrous media remain a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that engineering the surface of a protein to yield protein–polymer surfactant nanoconstructs allows for dissolution of dry protein into dry ionic liquids. Using myoglobin as a model protein, we show that this method can deliver protein molecules with near native structure into both hydrophilic and hydrophobic anhydrous ionic liquids.

abstract = {Fourier transform IR spectroscopy has been used to investigate the interaction of carbon dioxide with polymers. IR transmission and attenuated total reflectance spectra were obtained for CO2 impregnated into polymer films. It has been shown that the polymers possessing electron-donating functional groups (e.g., carbonyl groups) exhibit specific interactions with CO2, most probably of Lewis acid−base nature. An unusual aspect is the use of the bending mode ($\nu$2) of CO2 to probe polymer−CO2 interactions. The evidence of the interaction is the observation of the splitting of the band corresponding to the CO2 $\nu$2 mode. This splitting indicates that the double degeneracy of the $\nu$2 mode is removed due to the interaction of electron lone pairs of the carbonyl oxygen with the carbon atom of the CO2 molecule. This splitting has not been observed for polymers lacking electron-donating functional groups (e.g., poly(ethylene)). In contrast, the $\nu$3 mode shows little if any sensitivity to this interaction, which is in accordance with the interaction where CO2 molecule acts as an electron acceptor. Finally, the chemical and engineering implications of this type of specific interaction of CO2 with polymers are discussed; perhaps the changes in spectra of CO2 incorporated into polymers might serve as a basis for prediction of the solubility of CO2 in polymers.},

Small neutral solutes diffuse much faster than expected, whereas small charged solutes diffuse much slower. This article attempts to establish a link between the local friction experienced by tracer solutes and the polar/apolar structure of ionic liquids. We find that small neutral solutes probe locally “stiff” (mostly charged, high electrostriction) regions and locally “soft” (mostly apolar, low electrostriction) regions. These regions of high and low friction are associated with cage and jump regimes. Enhanced neutral tracer mobility in the low friction regions associated with the cationic apolar component has an important bearing on the large positive deviations from Stokes–Einstein behavior. In contrast, diminished charged tracer mobility involves long caging dynamics separated by jump events often triggered by the loss and recovery of counterions.},

abstract = {Vibrational relaxation and hydrogen bond dynamics in methanol-d dissolved in CCl4 have been measured with ultrafast infrared pump−probe spectroscopy. We excited the subensemble of methanol-d molecules both accepting and donating hydrogen bonds at ∼2500 cm-1. Following vibrational relaxation with a ∼500 fs lifetime, the signal does not decay to zero. Rather, the signal increases to a second maximum at ∼4 ps. The decay from the second maximum occurs on two time scales. We propose a model in which hydrogen bond dissociation, following vibrational relaxation, decreases the concentration of methanol-d molecules that accept and donate hydrogen bonds and produce the observed long-lived bleach of the absorption signal. Using a set of coupled kinetic equations, the time constants for hydrogen bond dissociation and reformation have been determined. Hydrogen bond breaking occurs with ∼200 fs and ∼2 ps time constants. We attribute the fast rate to a direct breaking mechanism wherein the excited hydroxyl stretch decays into modes that directly lead to the hydrogen bond dissociation. The slower rate of breaking is attributed to an indirect mechanism wherein the dissociation of hydrogen bonds follows vibrational energy flow from the initially excited molecule to other components of the same oligomer. The final stage of relaxation, after the second maximum, involves reformation of transiently broken hydrogen bonds. The bonds that break directly recover with ∼7 ps and ≫10 ns time constants, while the bonds that break indirectly recover with ∼20 ps and ≫10 ns time constants. Experiments conducted on ethanol-d solutions in CCl4 demonstrate that the same vibrational relaxation and hydrogen bond dynamic events occur with very similar amplitudes and rate constants. Measurements of the rates of spectral diffusion and polarization anisotropy decay via vibrational excitation transfer and orientational relaxation verify that the initial fast decay of the signal is dominated by vibrational relaxation.},

abstract = {2-Methoxyphenol (2MP) solutes form weak complexes with toluene solvent molecules. The complexes are unusual in that the 2MP hydroxyl has an intramolecular hydrogen bond and simultaneously forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with toluene and other aromatic solvents. In the equilibrated solute−solvent solution, there exists approximately the same concentration of 2MP−toluene complex and free 2MP. The very fast formation and dissociation (chemical exchange) of this type of three-centered hydrogen bond complex were observed in real time under thermal equilibrium conditions with two-dimensional (2D) infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy. Chemical exchange is manifested in the 2D spectrum by the growth of off-diagonal peaks. Both the formation and dissociation can be characterized in terms of the dissociation time constant, which was determined to be 3 ps for the 2MP−toluene complex. The intra−intermolecular hydrogen bond formation is influenced by subtle details of the molecular structure. Although 2MP forms a complex with toluene, it is demonstrated that 2-ethoxyphenol (2EP) does not form complexes to any significant extent. Density functional calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level suggest that steric effects caused by the extra methyl group in 2EP are responsible for the difference.},

abstract = {Rhodopsin is a prototypical heptahelical family A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for dim-light vision. Light isomerizes rhodopsin's retinal chromophore and triggers concerted movements of transmembrane helices, including an outward tilting of helix 6 (H6) and a smaller movement of H5, to create a site for G-protein binding and activation. However, the precise temporal sequence and mechanism underlying these helix rearrangements is unclear. We used site-directed non-natural amino acid mutagenesis to engineer rhodopsin with p-azido-l-phenylalanine residues incorporated at selected sites, and monitored the azido vibrational signatures using infrared spectroscopy as rhodopsin proceeded along its activation pathway. Here we report significant changes in electrostatic environments of the azido probes even in the inactive photoproduct Meta I, well before the active receptor state was formed. These early changes suggest a significant rotation of H6 and movement of the cytoplasmic part of H5 away from H3. Subsequently, a large outward tilt of H6 leads to opening of the cytoplasmic surface to form the active receptor photoproduct Meta II. Thus, our results reveal early conformational changes that precede larger rigid-body helix movements, and provide a basis to interpret recent GPCR crystal structures and to understand conformational sub-states observed during the activation of other GPCRs.},

The solvent has to provide a potential well to accommodate the discharged proton, screen it from the negative charge of the conjugated base, and provide an efficient mode for the diffusion of the proton to the bulk. On measuring the dynamics of proton dissociation in the time-resolved domain, the kinetic analysis of the reaction can quantitate the properties of the immediate environment. In this review we implement the kinetic analysis for evaluating the properties of small cavities in proteins and the diffusion of protons within narrow channels. On the basis of this analysis,we discuss how the clustering of proton-binding sites on a surface can endow the surface with enhanced capacity to attract protons and to funnel them toward a specific site.},

abstract = {Surface plasmons have been accessed with mid-IR light on Ni microarrays of subwavelength apertures using zeroth-order FTIR transmission spectra. A number of transmission resonances are observed throughout the mid-IR region, which is particularly interesting because nickel's dielectric properties are unfavorable in the visible. On the strongest resonance, these microarrays transmit about 3 times the intensity of light that is directly incident upon the holes (i.e., they exhibit Ebbesen's extraordinary transmission effect). A study is presented of the dispersion and line shape of resonances for a mesh of well-defined geometry (6.5-mm-wide square holes, square lattice with 12.7-mm hole-to-hole spacing, and 5-mm thickness). The dispersion diagram reveals large band gaps (as a fraction of the resonance energy) that are complicated by the lifting of nominally degenerate resonances. The line shape of the most isolated resonance was fit to a damped harmonic oscillator model revealing the complex dielectric parameters including the damping constant. Lifetimes obtained from the damping constants range from 80 to 510 fs and exhibit an exponential dependence on the resonance wavelength. A great enhancement of resonant transmission relative to the fractional open area has also been observed upon stacking two or more meshes on top of each other. The metallic microarray transmission geometry converts the photon energy to surface plasmon polaritons traveling along the metal surface and therefore through coatings, membranes, or monolayers on the mesh. This dramatically changes the path length in absorption experiments from about twice the thickness of the coating (as it is in reflection absorption experiments) to the thickness of the microchannel and more, which could amount in practice to a 1000-fold enhancement in the fraction of light absorbed. These observations suggest opportunities for using these resonances in sensitive detection schemes with vibrational spectroscopies to detect molecular surface species. We show one exciting outcome that involves some unusually large absorbances by 1-dodecanethiolate monolayers on these Ni meshes.},

abstract = {Microemulsions form in mixtures of polar, nonpolar, and amphiphilic molecules. Typical microemulsions employ water as the polar phase. However, microemulsions can form with a polar phase other than water, which hold promise to diversify the range of properties, and hence utility, of microemulsions. Here microemulsions formed by using a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as the polar phase were created and characterized by using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. (1)H, (11)B, and (19)F NMR spectroscopy was applied to explore differences between microemulsions formed by using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF(4)]) as the polar phase with a cationic surfactant, benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium chloride (BHDC), and a nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100 (TX-100). NMR spectroscopy showed distinct differences in the behavior of the RTIL as the charge of the surfactant head group varies in the different microemulsion environments. Minor changes in the chemical shifts were observed for [bmim](+) and [BF(4)](-) in the presence of TX-100 suggesting that the surfactant and the ionic liquid are separated in the microemulsion. The large changes in spectroscopic parameters observed are consistent with microstructure formation with layering of [bmim](+) and [BF(4)](-) and migration of Cl(-) within the BHDC microemulsions. Comparisons with NMR results for related ionic compounds in organic and aqueous environments as well as literature studies assisted the development of a simple organizational model for these microstructures.},

The time resolution of the monitoring system can follow the diffusion-controlled protonation of specific sites on macromolecular bodies [Gutman, M. (1984) Methods Biochem. Anal. 30, 1-103]. In order to apply this method in enzymology, one must first evaluate how the buffer capacity of biochemical systems (substrates and proteins) will affect the observed dynamics. Unlike equilibrium measurements, where buffer is an inert component, in kinetic studies buffer modulates the observed dynamics. In this paper we analyze the effect of buffer on the dynamics of protonation in a model system. We describe the experimental technique and introduce the mathematical formalism that determines the various rate constants involved in the reaction. The analysis of the experiments indicates that in buffered solution proton flux is carried by two mechanisms: (A) proton dissociation followed by free proton diffusion; (B) collisional proton transfer between small diffusing solutes. We demonstrate how to evaluate the contribution of each pathway to the overall proton flux.},

abstract = {The calcium binding proteins of the EF-hand super-family are involved in the regulation of all aspects of cell function. These proteins exhibit a great diversity of composition, structure, Ca2+-binding and target interaction properties. Here, our current understanding of the Ca2+-binding mechanism is assessed. The structures of the EF-hand motifs containing 11-14 amino acid residues in the Ca2+-binding loop are analyzed within the framework of the recently proposed two-step Ca2+-binding mechanism. A hypothesis is put forward that in all EF-hand proteins the Ca2+-binding and the resultant conformational responses are governed by the central structure connecting the Ca2+-binding loops in the two-EF-hand domain. This structure, named EF??-scaffold, defines the position of the bound Ca2+, and coordinates the function of the N-terminal (variable and flexible) with the C-terminal (invariable and rigid) parts of the Ca2+-binding loop. It is proposed that the nature of the first ligand of the Ca2+-binding loop is an important determinant of the conformational change. Additional factors, including the interhelical contacts, the length, structure and flexibility of the linker connecting the EF-hand motifs, and the overall energy balance provide the fine-tuning of the Ca2+-induced conformational change in the EF-hand proteins. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Examples of such systems include ionic liquids, TIPnP-type models of water, protein force fields, and others, where interactions and dynamics of inherently polarizable species can be accurately described by nonpolarizable models. To describe electrostatic interactions, the effective charges of simple ionic liquids are obtained by scaling the actual charges of ions by a factor of 1/√($\epsilon$(el)), which is due to electronic polarization screening effect; the scaling factor of neutral species is more complicated. Here, using several theoretical models, we examine how exactly the scaling factors appear in theory, and how, and under what conditions, polarizable Hamiltonians are reduced to nonpolarizable ones. These models allow one to trace the origin of the scaling factors, determine their values, and obtain important insights on the nature of polarizable interactions in condensed matter systems.},

Sci. Instrum. 56:283-290), has been developed with significant advances in mixer design, detection method and data analysis. To overcome the problems associated with the free-flowing jet used for observation in the original design (instability, optical artifacts due to scattering, poor definition of the geometry), the solution emerging from the capillary is injected directly into a flow-cell joined to the tip of the outer capillary via a ground-glass joint. The reaction kinetics are followed by measuring fluorescence versus distance downstream from the mixer, using an Hg(Xe) arc lamp for excitation and a digital camera with a UV-sensitized CCD detector for detection. Test reactions involving fluorescent dyes indicate that mixing is completed within 15 micros of its initiation and that the dead time of the measurement is 45 +/- 5 micros, which represents a >30-fold improvement in time resolution over conventional stopped-flow instruments. The high sensitivity and linearity of the CCD camera have been instrumental in obtaining artifact-free kinetic data over the time window from approximately 45 micros to a few milliseconds with signal-to-noise levels comparable to those of conventional methods. The scope of the method is discussed and illustrated with an example of a protein folding reaction.},

abstract = {Diffusion coefficients of a variety of dilute solutes in the series of 1-alkyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imides ([Prn1][Tf2N], n = 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10), trihexyltetracedecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [P14,666][Tf2N], and assorted imidazolium ionic liquids are measured using pulsed field gradient (1)H NMR. These data, combined with available literature data, are used to try to uncover the solute and solvent characteristics most important in determining tracer diffusion rates. Discussion is framed in terms of departures from simple hydrodynamic predictions for translational friction using the ratio $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE, where $\zeta$obs is the observed friction, determined from the measured diffusion coefficient D via $\zeta$obs = kBT/D, and $\zeta$SE = 6$\pi$$\eta$R is the Stokes friction on a sphere of radius R (determined from the solute van der Waals volume) in a solvent with viscosity $\eta$. In the case of neutral solutes, the primary determinant of whether hydrodynamic predictions are accurate is the relative size of solute versus solvent molecules. A single correlation, albeit with considerable scatter, is found between $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE and the ratio of solute-to-solvent van der Waals volumes, $\zeta$obs/$\zeta$SE = {1 + a(VU/VV)(-p)}, with constants a = 1.93 and p = 1.88. In the case of small solutes, the observed friction is over 100-fold smaller than predictions of hydrodynamic models. The dipole moment of the solute has little effect on the friction, whereas solute charge has a marked effect. For monovalent solutes of size comparable to or smaller than the solvent ions, the observed friction is comparable to or even greater than what is predicted by hydrodynamics. These general trends are shown to be quite similar to what is observed for tracer diffusion in conventional solvents.},

abstract = {Vibrational excitation transfer along the hydrogen-bond-mediated pathways in the complex of methyl acetate (MA) and 4-cyanophenol (4CP) was studied with dual-frequency femtosecond two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. We excited the energy-donating ester carbonyl stretching vibrational mode and followed the transfer to the energy-accepting benzene ring and cyano stretching vibrations. The complexes with none, one, and two hydrogen-bonded 4CP molecules were studied. Vibrational relaxation of the carbonyl mode is more efficient in both hydrogen-bonded complexes as compared with free MA molecules. The inter-molecular transport in a hydrogen-bonded complex involving a single 4CP molecule is slower than that in a complex with two 4CP molecules. In the former, vibrational relaxation leads to local heating, as shown by the spectroscopy of the carbonyl mode, whereas the local heating is suppressed in the latter because the excitation redistribution is more efficient. At early times, the transfer to the benzene ring is governed by its direct coupling with the energy-donating carbonyl mode, whereas at later times the intermediate states are involved. The transfer to a more distant site of the cyano group in 4CP involves intermediate states at all times, since no direct coupling between the energy-donating and accepting modes was observed. We anticipate that our findings will be of importance for spectroscopic studies of bio-molecular structures and dynamics, inter- and intra-molecular signaling pathways, and for developing molecular networking applications.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

The slower tail is exponential with a decay time of ∼200 fs. Comparison of the results to molecular dynamics simulations performed by Maroncelli [J. Chem.

abstract = {Proteins, enzymes, and other biological molecules undergo structural dynamics as an intrinsic part of their biological functions. While many biological processes occur on the millisecond, second, and even longer time scales, the fundamental structural dynamics that eventually give rise to such processes occur on much faster time scales. Many decades ago, chemical kineticists focused on the inverse of the reaction rate constant as the important time scale for a chemical reaction. However, through transition state theory and a vast amount of experimental evidence, we now know that the key events in a chemical reaction can involve structural fluctuations that take a system of reactants to its transition state, the crossing of a barrier, and the eventual relaxation to product states. Such dynamics occur on very fast time scales. Today researchers would like to investigate the fast structural fluctuations of biological molecules to gain an understanding of how biological processes proceed from simple structural changes in biomolecules to the final, complex biological function. The study of the fast structural dynamics of biological molecules requires experiments that operate on the appropriate time scales, and in this Account, we discuss the application of ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy to the study of protein dynamics. The 2D IR vibrational echo experiment is akin to 2D NMR, but it operates on time scales many orders of magnitude faster. In the experiments, a particular vibrational oscillator serves as a vibrational dynamics probe. As the structure of the protein evolves in time, the structural changes are manifested as time-dependent changes in the frequency of the vibrational dynamics probe. The 2D IR vibrational echo experiments can track the vibrational frequency evolution, which we then relate to the time evolution of the protein structure. In particular, we measured protein substate interconversion for mutants of myoglobin using 2D IR chemical exchange spectroscopy and observed well-defined substate interconversion on a sub-100 ps time scale. In another study, we investigated the influence of binding five different substrates to the enzyme cytochrome P450(cam). The various substrates affect the enzyme dynamics differently, and the observed dynamics are correlated with the enzyme's selectivity of hydroxylation of the substrates and with the substrate binding affinity.},

The micelles are assumed to have a completely segregated core region consisting only of the A block and a shell region consisting of the solventS and the solvent compatible B block. The theory allows one to predict the critical micelle concentration, the micelle size distribution, the average aggregation number, as well as the core radius and the shell thickness of the micelle. The novel outcome of the present theory, in contrast to the treatments of micellization pioneered by de Gennes, Leibler, Orland, and Wheeler, and Noolandi and Hong, is its prediction that the solvent compatible B block plays an important role in determining the micellization behavior. The influence of the B block becomes relatively more prominent in systems where the solventS constitutes a very good solvent for the B block. Further, scaling relations that are not system specific have been developed relating explicitly the micellar size parameters to the characteristics of the block copolymer and the solvent.},

abstract = {Water is the most abundant liquid on earth and also the substance with the largest number of anomalies in its properties. It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid−liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques.},

abstract = {Vibrational spectra of BH(4)(-) and its isotopic analogues in a crystalline environment of alkali metals cations (K(+), Rb(+), Cs(+)) have been investigated beyond the harmonic approximation using a variational approach supported by computations of B3LYP type anharmonic force fields. From the comparison of the observed and simulated IR spectra, the influence of the anharmonic couplings on the band position and on the relative intensity of the allowed vibrational transitions is discussed. Here, the effect of the crystalline environment induces a blue shift of about 50 and 100 cm(-1) respectively for the bending and stretching modes of BH(4)(-). Furthermore, anharmonic effects, which are exclusively well reproduced by a variational approach, are needed to yield reliable positions and relative amplitudes of IR allowed combination and overtone transitions. This leads to theoretical results fitting their experimental counterpart between 6 and 30 cm(-1) in the investigated series.},

abstract = {The [(CO2)n(H2O)]- cluster anions are studied using infrared photodissociation (IPD) spectroscopy in the 2800-3800 cm(-1) range. The observed IPD spectra display a drastic change in the vibrational band features at n = 4, indicating a sharp discontinuity in the structural evolution of the monohydrated cluster anions. The n = 2 and 3 spectra are composed of a series of sharp bands around 3600 cm(-1), which are assignable to the stretching vibrations of H2O bound to C2O4- in a double ionic hydrogen-bonding (DIHB) configuration, as was previously discussed (J. Chem. Phys. 2005, 122, 094303). In the n > or = 4 spectrum, a pair of intense bands additionally appears at approximately 3300 cm(-1). With the aid of ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-31+G* level, the 3300 cm(-1) bands are assigned to the bending overtone and the hydrogen-bonded OH vibration of H2O bound to CO2- via a single O-H...O linkage. Thus, the structures of [(CO2)n(H2O)]- evolve with cluster size such that DIHB to C2O4- is favored in the smaller clusters with n = 2 and 3 whereas CO2- is preferentially stabilized via the formation of a single ionic hydrogen-bonding (SIHB) configuration in the larger clusters with n > or = 4.},

This family of compounds has grown to include a variety of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives with activity in both solid tumours and malignant disorders of the blood. These agents behave as antimetabolites, compete with physiological nucleosides, and interact with a large number of intracellular targets to induce cytotoxicity. Progress has recently been made in the identification and characterisation of nucleoside transporters and the enzymes of nucleoside metabolism. In addition, there is now greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anticancer nucleoside activity, which provides opportunities for potentiating their antitumour effects. Strategies to optimise intracellular analogue accumulation and to enhance cancer-cell selectivity are proving beneficial in clinical trials.},

At the surface it is unclear which functional groups are present, how they are arranged, and how they interact with each other and with solutes as the key bonds are activated. An alternative approach has developed whereby reactions are studied with nanometre-sized aqueous oxide ions that serve as models for the more complicated oxide interface. For these ions, establishing the structure is not a research problem in itself, and bond ruptures and dissociations can be followed with much confidence.

abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are liquids consisting entirely of ions, and their important properties, e.g., negligible vapor pressure, are considered to result from the ionic nature. However, we do not know how ionic the RTILs are. The ionic nature of the RTILs is defined in this study as the molar conductivity ratio (Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR)), calculated from the molar conductivity measured by the electrochemical impedance method (Lambda(imp)) and that estimated by use of pulse-field-gradient spin-echo NMR ionic self-diffusion coefficients and the Nernst-Einstein relation (Lambda(NMR)). This ratio is compared with solvatochromic polarity scales: anionic donor ability (Lewis basicity), E(T)(30), hydrogen bond donor acidity (alpha), and dipolarity/polarizability (pi), as well as NMR chemical shifts. The Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR) well illustrates the degree of cation-anion aggregation in the RTILs at equilibrium, which can be explained by the effects of anionic donor and cationic acceptor abilities for the RTILs having different anionic and cationic backbone structures with fixed counterparts, and by the inductive and dispersive forces for the various alkyl chain lengths in the cations. As a measure of the electrostatic interaction of the RTILs, the effective ionic concentration (C(eff)), which is a dominant parameter for the electrostatic forces of the RTILs, was introduced as the product of Lambda(imp)/Lambda(NMR) and the molar concentration and was compared with some physical properties, such as reported normal boiling points and distillation rates, glass transition temperature, and viscosity. A decrease in C(eff) of the RTILs is well correlated with the normal boiling point and distillation rate, whereas the liquid-state dynamics is controlled by a subtle balance between the electrostatic and other intermolecular forces.},

abstract = {This tutorial review outlines current state of the art research on ionic liquid lubricants. Ionic liquids (ILs) were first reported as very promising high-performance lubricants in 2001 and have attracted considerable attention in the field of tribology since then because of their remarkable lubrication and anti-wear capabilities as compared with lubrication oils in general use; in recent times we have seen dramatically increased interest in the topic. The review starts with a brief introduction to ILs and fluid lubrication, and then discusses in more detail the tribological properties of IL lubricants, either as lubrication oils, additives or thin films. As well as lubrication mechanisms, some current problems and potential solutions are tentatively discussed.},

abstract = {Vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) was used for in situ studies of the electrified interface of the negative electrode (anode) of a lithium battery analog. In a lithium battery, lithium is deposited interstitially in a carbon anode. In the model system, which facilitates the study of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) the anode was Au and lithium was deposited on the anode surface. The electrolyte was LiClO4 plus ethylene carbonate (EC) and diluted with tetrahydrofuran (THF). The SEI created on the anode in this case consists primarily of lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LiEDC) and lithium salts. SFG experiments were run during multiple cycles of reduction and oxidation of a half-cell, corresponding to charging and discharging of a battery. The infrared (IR) pulses were tuned to EC carbonyl transitions or −CH2 transitions of LiEDC and THF. A model is introduced to describe potential-dependent SFG intensities at electrified interfaces when the electrolyte has intense IR transitions. The electrified interface is defined as consisting of the electrode−electrolyte (or electrode−SEI) interface, plus bulk material located within a Debye length of the electrode. We show that SFG can detect and characterize the underpotential deposition and stripping of lithium on the Au anode, and we observe the growth and structural evolution of the SEI at the anode. During the first three charge/discharge cycles, SEI growth is hindered by the presence of THF, but after the third cycle the THF has been expelled and SEI growth accelerates and then levels off.},

abstract = {S100 proteins (16 members) show a very divergent pattern of cell- and tissue-specific expression, of subcellular localizations and relocations, of post-translational modifications, and of affinities for Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+, consistent with their pleiotropic intra- and extracellular functions. Up to 40 target proteins are reported to interact with S100 proteins and for S100A1 alone 15 target proteins are presently known. Therefore it is not surprising that many functional roles have been proposed and that several human disorders such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, inflammations, diabetes, and allergies are associated with an altered expression of S100 proteins. It is not unlikely that their biological activity in some cases is regulated by Zn2+ and Cu2+, rather than by Ca2+. Despite the numerous putative functions of S100 proteins, their three-dimensional structures of, e.g., S100B, S100A6, and S100A7 are surprisingly similar. They contain a compact dimerization domain whose conformation is rather insensitive to Ca2+ binding and two lateral alpha-helices III and III, which project outward of each subunit when Ca2+ is bound. Target docking depends on the two hydrophobic patches in front of the paired EF-hand generated by the binding of Ca2+. The selectivity in target binding is assured by the central linker between the two EF-hands and the C-terminal tail. It appears that the S100-binding domain in some target proteins contains a basic amphiphilic alpha-helix and that the mode of interaction and activation bears structural similarity to that of calmodulin.},

abstract = {We study the ice-binding site (IBS) of a hyperactive antifreeze protein from the beetle Dendroides canadensis (DAFP-1) using vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy. We find that DAFP-1 accumulates at the air?water interface due to the hydrophobic character of its threonine-rich IBS while retaining its highly regular ?-helical fold. We observe a narrow band at 3485 cm?1 that we assign to the O?H stretch vibration of threonine hydroxyl groups of the IBS. The narrow character of the 3485 cm?1 band suggests that the hydrogen bonds between the threonine residues at the IBS and adjacent water molecules are quite similar in strength, indicating that the IBS of DAFP-1 is extremely well-ordered, with the threonine side chains showing identical rotameric confirmations. The hydrogen-bonded water molecules do not form an ordered ice-like layer, as was recently observed for the moderate antifreeze protein type III. It thus appears that the antifreeze action of DAFP-1 does not require the presence of ordered water but likely results from the direct binding of its highly ordered array of threonine residues to the ice surface.},

@article{Damaghi2013,
abstract = {Cells maintain intracellular pH (pHi) within a narrow range (7.1-7.2) by controlling membrane proton pumps and transporters whose activity is set by intra-cytoplasmic pH sensors. These sensors have the ability to recognize and induce cellular responses to maintain the pHi, often at the expense of acidifying the extracellular pH. In turn, extracellular acidification impacts cells via specific acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this review, we will discuss some of the major players in proton sensing at the plasma membrane and their downstream consequences in cancer cells and how these pH-mediated changes affect processes such as migration and metastasis. The complex mechanisms by which they transduce acid pH signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus are not well understood. However, there is evidence that expression of proton-sensing GPCRs such as GPR4, TDAG8, and OGR1 can regulate aspects of tumorigenesis and invasion, including cofilin and talin regulated actin (de-)polymerization. Major mechanisms for maintenance of pHi homeostasis include monocarboxylate, bicarbonate, and proton transporters. Notably, there is little evidence suggesting a link between their activities and those of the extracellular H(+)-sensors, suggesting a mechanistic disconnect between intra- and extracellular pH. Understanding the mechanisms of pH sensing and regulation may lead to novel and informed therapeutic strategies that can target acidosis, a common physical hallmark of solid tumors.},

Using gas-phase catalytic reaction studies and in situ sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG) to study Pt/TiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts, a unique reaction pathway was identified for Pt/TiO2, which selectively produces alcohol products. The catalytic and spectroscopic data obtained for the Pt/SiO2 catalyst shows that SiO2 has no active role in this reaction. SFG spectra obtained for the Pt/TiO2 catalyst indicate the presence of a crotyl-oxy surface intermediate. By adsorption through the aldehyde oxygen atom to an O-vacancy site on the TiO2 surface, the C=O bond of crotonaldehyde is activated, by charge transfer, for hydrogenation. This intermediate reacts with spillover H provided by the Pt to produce crotyl alcohol.},

The present results showed that the structure of dominant clusters formed in the mixtures at 25°C is still kept at low temperatures, except that O⋯O hydrogen bonds formed in the mixtures are gradually ordered with lowering temperature. At the freezing point temperatures, ice Ih is crystallized in methanol-water and ethanol-water mixtures below the mole fraction of structural transition. Above the mole fraction of structural transition, methanol-water mixtures are kept in the metastable liquid state, but ethanol hydrate is crystallized in ethanol-water mixtures. In the case of 2-propanol-water mixtures, ice Ih is crystallized from the mixtures at all the mole fractions (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) investigated because microheterogeneity in 2-propanol-water mixtures at 25°C is most enhanced among the three alcohol-water mixtures. From the present results, it was concluded that the structure of dominant clusters formed in the mixtures at the ambient temperature is reflected into that of frozen alcohol-water mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Detailed analysis of the waiting-time dependence of certain cross-peak amplitudes shows modulation at multiple frequencies, providing a direct signature of excited vibrational coherences resulting from coherence transfer. A new signature of coherence transfer is observed as temporally modulated cross-peak amplitudes with more than one modulation frequency. The relative importance of different coherence transfer paths is considered in the context of the orientational response of a system which includes two vibrational modes with parallel dipole moments. Since MDIR spectroscopy enables spectral isolation of individual excited vibrational coherences (i.e., coherences between fundamental excitations), these experiments report directly on the frequency-frequency correlation functions of the excited states relative to each other as well as relative to the ground state. These results highlight the rich information contained in fully exploring three-dimensional third-order spectroscopy, particularly regarding chemically relevant slower dynamics and the importance of intramolecular interactions leading to dephasing by optically dark or low-frequency modes of the molecule.},

We present a combination of force field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations together with neutron scattering experiments with isotopic substitution that aim at characterizing ion hydration and pairing in aqueous calcium chloride and formate/acetate solutions. Benchmarking against neutron scattering data on concentrated solutions together with ion pairing free energy profiles from ab initio molecular dynamics allows us to develop an accurate calcium force field which accounts in a mean-field way for electronic polarization effects via charge rescaling. This refined calcium parameterization is directly usable for standard molecular dynamics simulations of processes involving this key biological signaling ion.},

abstract = {M-Pos172 KINETICS OF CALCIUM DISSOCIATION FROM CALMODULIN BY QUIN-2. Marcia A. Tudor and Howard 
D. White, Department of Biochemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721. 
The fluorescent calcium indicator, QUIN-2 (Tsien, Biochemistry 19, 2396 (1980)) has been used to 
measure the kinetics of calcium dissociation from calmodulin. The increase in QUIN-2 fluorescence 
observed upon mixing with bovine calmodulin in a stopped flow florimeter is biphasic. An initial 
rapid increase, which has an amplitude corresponding to 1-2 calcium per calmodulin occurs within the 
mixing time of the stopped-flow and therefore has a rate constant >500 s-1. The rate constant of 
the second slower phase of the reaction is 7 s-1 and has an amplitude corresponding to 2 calcium per 
calmodulin. The rate constant of calcium dissociation from the two slowly dissociating sites is 
identical to that measured for dissociation of calcium from the two high affinity sites (Kd 'X' 10-6 
M) by changes in tyrosine fluorescence. The rapid initial fluorescence increase must therefore be a 
measure of calcium dissociation from the low affinity sites (Kd X' 10-5 M). A minimal kinetic 
mechanism obtained for calcium binding to calmodulin obtained from this data and previous results 
obtained in this laboratory (H. D. White et al. Biophys. J. 37, 5la (1982) is:

abstract = {The ability to couple problem solving both to the understanding of chemical concepts and to laboratory practices is an essential skill for undergraduate chemistry programs to foster in our students. Therefore, chemistry programs must offer opportunities to answer real problems that require use of problem-solving processes used by practicing chemists, including those of experimental design. Additionally, programs should assess the extent to which these skills are mastered by students and use the results to inform curricular development. This manuscript describes a rubric for experimental problem solving in chemistry that seeks to assess the extent to which students can both understand a chemical problem and design an instrument-based strategy to address it. The rubric effectively differentiates responses to practicum questions answered by students at different stages of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The data show that students improve in their ability to problem solve as they progress through the program. On average, students are able to provide a “correct” answer before they are able to articulate a complete understanding of the problem or to justify their choices. The rubric will be useful to others seeking to study or assess student problem-solving skills at both the course and curricular levels.},

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy has been proven to be an exceptionally useful method to study chemical exchange processes between different vibrational chromophores under thermal equilibria. Here, we present experimental results on the thermal equilibrium ion pairing dynamics of Li(+) and SCN(-) ions in N,N-dimethylformamide. Li(+) and SCN(-) ions can form a contact ion pair (CIP). Varying the relative concentration of Li(+) in solution, we could control the equilibrium CIP and free SCN(-) concentrations. Since the CN stretch frequency of Li-SCN CIP is blue-shifted by about 16 cm(-1) from that of free SCN(-) ion, the CN stretch IR spectrum is a doublet. The temperature-dependent IR absorption spectra reveal that the CIP formation is an endothermic (0.57 kJ∕mol) process and the CIP state has larger entropy by 3.12 J∕(K mol) than the free ion states. Since the two ionic configurations are spectrally distinguishable, this salt solution is ideally suited for nonlinear IR spectroscopic investigations to study ion pair association and dissociation dynamics. Using polarization-controlled IR pump-probe methods, we first measured the lifetimes and orientational relaxation times of these two forms of ionic configurations. The vibrational population relaxation times of both the free ion and CIP are about 32 ps. However, the orientational relaxation time of the CIP, which is ∼47 ps, is significantly longer than that of the free SCN(-), which is ∼7.7 ps. This clearly indicates that the effective moment of inertia of the CIP is much larger than that of the free SCN(-). Then, using chemical exchange 2DIR spectroscopy and analyzing the diagonal peak and cross-peak amplitude changes with increasing the waiting time, we determined the contact ion pair association and dissociation time constants that are found to be 165 and 190 ps, respectively. The results presented and discussed in this paper are believed to be important, not only because the ion-pairing dynamics is one of the most fundamental physical chemistry problems but also because such molecular ion-ion interactions are of critical importance in understanding Hofmeister effects on protein stability.},

Simulations of an isolated water molecule embedded in 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [bmim][PF6], were performed to shed insight into the nature of these coupled water-ion dynamics. The theoretical calculations of the spectral diffusion dynamics and the infrared absorption spectra of the OD stretch of isolated HOD in [bmim][PF6] agree well with experiment. The infrared absorption line shape of the OD stretch is narrower and blue-shifted in the IL compared to those in aqueous solution. Decomposition of the OD frequency time correlation function revealed that translational motions of the anions dominate the spectral diffusion dynamics.},

In both the neat ionic liquid and the microemulsion, the solvation dynamics is found to depend on excitation wavelength (lambda(ex)). The lambda(ex) dependence is attributed to structural heterogeneity in neat ionic liquid (IL) and in IL microemulsion. In neat IL, the heterogeneity arises from clustering of the pentyl groups which are surrounded by a network of cation and anions. Such a nanostructural organization is predicted in many recent simulations and observed recently in an X-ray diffraction study. In an IL microemulsion, the surfactant (TX-100) molecules aggregate in form of a nonpolar peripheral shell around the polar pool of IL. The micro-environment in such an assembly varies drastically over a short distance. The dynamic solvent shift (and average solvation time) in neat IL as well as in IL microemulsions decreases markedly as lambda(ex) increases from 375 to 435 nm. In a [pmim][BF4]/water/TX-100/benzene quaternary microemulsion, the solvation dynamics is slower than that in a microemulsion without water. This is ascribed to the smaller size of the water containing microemulsion. The anisotropy decay in an IL microemulsion is found to be faster than that in neat IL.},

abstract = {We have recently developed a new and simple way of collecting 2D infrared and visible spectra that utilizes a pulse shaper and a partly collinear beam geometry. 2D IR and Vis spectroscopies are powerful tools for studying molecular structures and their dynamics. They can be used to correlate vibrational or electronic eigenstates, measure energy transfer rates, and quantify the dynamics of lineshapes, for instance, all with femtosecond time-resolution. As a result, they are finding use in systems that exhibit fast dynamics, such as sub-millisecond chemical and biological dynamics, and in hard-to-study environments, such as in membranes. While powerful, these techniques have been difficult to implement because they require a series of femtosecond pulses to be spatially and temporally overlapped with precise time-resolution and interferometric phase stability. However, many of the difficulties associated with implementing 2D spectroscopies are eliminated by using a pulse shaper and a simple beam geometry, which substantially lowers the technical barriers required for researchers to enter this exciting field while simultaneously providing many new capabilities. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the methods for collecting 2D spectra so that an outsider considering using 2D spectroscopy in their own research can judge which approach would be most suitable for their research aims. This paper focuses primarily on 2D IR spectroscopy, but also includes our recent work on adapting this technology to collecting 2D Vis spectra. We review work that has already been published as well as cover several topics that we have not reported previously, including phase cycling methods to remove background signals, eliminate unwanted scatter, and shift data collection into the rotating frame.},

Several fundamental studies designed to elucidate the molecular and macromolecular origins of the chiral responses are reviewed to provide a framework for development of this emerging field. In general, the chiral activity in SHG and SFG has the potential to arise from complex interactions between hosts of different competing effects. Fortunately, relatively simple electric dipole-allowed mechanisms routinely dominate the nonlinear optical chiral activities of most practical systemsexpressions can often be generated to link the. This substantial reduction in complexity allows for the development of simple models connecting the macroscopic nonlinear optical response to intuitive molecular and supramolecular properties.},

abstract = {The issues of electronic polarizability in molecular dynamics simulations are discussed. We argue that the charges of ionized groups in proteins, and charges of ions in conventional non-polarizable force fields such as CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS, etc should be scaled by a factor about 0.7. Our model explains why a neglect of electronic solvation energy, which typically amounts to about a half of total solvation energy, in non-polarizable simulations with un-scaled charges can produce a correct result; however, the correct solvation energy of ions does not guarantee the correctness of ion-ion pair interactions in many non-polarizable simulations. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional non-polarizable force field simulations. The model also explains the striking difference between the value of water dipole $\mu$∼ 3D reported in recent ab initio and experimental studies with the value $\mu$(eff)∼ 2.3D typically used in the empirical potentials, such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the effective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value $\mu$(eff) = $\mu$/√$\epsilon$(el), where $\epsilon$(el) = 1.78 is the electronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple theoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the effective parameters, which is crucial when the computational models of liquid water are used for simulations in different environments, such as proteins, or for interaction with solutes.},

abstract = {Branching at the alkyl side chain of the imidazolium cation in ionic liquids (ILs) was evaluated towards its effect on carbon dioxide (CO2 ) solubilization at 10 and 80 bar (1 bar=1×10(5) Pa). By combining high-pressure NMR spectroscopy measurements with molecular dynamics simulations, a full description of the molecular interactions that take place in the IL-CO2 mixtures can be obtained. The introduction of a methyl group has a significant effect on CO2 solubility in comparison with linear or fluorinated analogues. The differences in CO2 solubility arise from differences in liquid organization caused by structural changes in the cation. ILs with branched cations have similar short-range cation-anion orientations as those in ILs with linear side chains, but present differences in the long-range order. The introduction of CO2 does not cause perturbations in the former and benefits from the differences in the latter. Branching at the cation results in sponge-like ILs with enhanced capabilities for CO2 capture.},

Recently, their unique materials and solvent properties and the growing interest in a sustainable, "green" chemistry has led to an amazing increase in interest in such salts. A huge number of potential cation and anion families and their many substitution patterns allows the desired properties for specific applications to be selected. Because it is impossible to experimentally investigate even a small fraction of the potential cation-anion combinations, a molecular-based understanding of their properties is crucial. However, the unusual complexity of their intermolecular interactions renders molecular-based interpretations difficult, and gives rise to many controversies, speculations, and even myths about the properties that ILs allegedly possess.

The temperatures cover the normal liquid state and the weakly supercooled state. The orientational dynamics exhibit characteristics typical of normal organic glass-forming liquids. The longest time scale portion of the data decays as a single exponential and obeys the Debye–Stokes–Einstein relation. The decay of the OHD-OKE signal begins (∼1 ps)(∼1 ps) with a temperature independent power law, t−z,t−z, z=1.02±0.05,z=1.02±0.05, the “intermediate power law.” The power law decay is followed by a crossover region, modeled as a second power law, the von Schweidler power law. The longest time scale decay is the exponential $\alpha$ relaxation. The intermediate power law decay has been observed in van der Waals supercooled liquids previously. These are the first such observations on an ionic organic liquid. The observation of the dynamical signatures observed in other liquids demonstrates that the orientational dynamics of ionic organic liquids are fundamentally the same as van der Waals liquids and supports the universality of the intermediate power law decay in the dynamics of complex liquids. Within the mode-coupling theory (MCT) framework, the MCT critical temperature TCTC is estimated to be TC≅255 K.},

We explored the effect of systematically changing the anionic and cationic components of the ionic liquid on the CO2−ionic liquid phase behavior. For all of the ionic liquids tested, large quantities of CO2 dissolved in the ionic liquid phase, but no appreciable amount of ionic liquid solubilized in the CO2 phase. In addition, the liquid phase volume expansion with the introduction of even large amounts of CO2 is negligible, in dramatic contrast to the large volume expansion observed for neutral organic liquids.

As the temperature decreases, the (18)O-induced (13)C chemical-shift separations increase not only at carboxyl carbons but also at ipso (alkene) carbons. The magnitude of the ipso increase is consistent with an (18)O isotope effect on carboxylic acid acidity. Therefore it is concluded that this monoanion is a mixture of tautomers in rapid equilibrium, rather than a single symmetric structure in which a chemical-shift separation arises from coupling between a desymmetrizing vibration and anharmonic isotope-dependent vibrations, which is expected to show the opposite temperature dependence.},

abstract = {Single-channel heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy for selectively measuring vibrational spectra of liquid interfaces is presented. This new methodology is based on optical interference between sum frequency signal light from a sample interface and phase-controlled local oscillator light. In single-channel HD-SFG, interferometric and spectrometric measurements are simultaneously carried out with an input IR laser scanned in a certain wavenumber range, which results in a less task than existing phase-sensitive sum frequency spectroscopy. The real and imaginary parts of second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility ($\chi$\r\n(2)) of interfaces are separately obtained with spectral resolution as high as 4 cm−1 that is approximately six times better than existing multiplex HD-SFG. In this paper, the experimental procedure and theoretical background of single-channel HD-SFG are explicated, and its application to the water/vapor interface is demonstrated, putting emphasis on the importance of a standard for the complex phase of $\chi$\r\n(2).},

abstract = {One of the possible solutions to prevent global climate change is the reduction of CO2 emissions, which is highly desired for the sustainable development of our society. In this work, the chemical absorption of carbon dioxide in amino acid ionic liquids was studied through first-principles methods. The use of readily accessible and biodegradable amino acids as building blocks for ionic liquids makes them highly promising replacements for the widely applied hazardous aqueous solutions of amines. A detailed insight into the reaction mechanism of the CO2 absorption was obtained through state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This allowed us to determine the reason for the specific CO2 capacities found experimentally. Moreover, we have also conducted a theoretical design of ionic liquids to provide valuable insights into the precise tuning of the energetic and kinetic parameters of the CO2 absorption.},

abstract = {We show how vibrational spectra obtained from quantum chemical calculations can be analyzed by transforming the calculated normal modes contributing to a certain band in the vibrational spectrum to a set of localized modes. This is achieved by determining the unitary transformation that leads to modes which are maximally localized with respect to a suitably defined criterion. We demonstrate that these localized modes are more appropriate for the analysis of calculated vibrational spectra of polypeptides and proteins than the normal modes, which are usually delocalized over the whole system. Both the frequencies at which the bands in the vibrational spectra appear and the total intensities of these bands can be interpreted in terms of the localized modes. Furthermore, we show how coupling constants for the interaction between the localized modes, which can be employed to rationalize the observed band shapes, can be extracted from the calculations.},

Our theoretical treatment is specifically aimed at addressing issues that accompany the relatively novel SFG approach using broadband infrared pulses. The ultrashort duration of these pulses makes them ideally suited for time-resolved investigations, for which we present a complete theoretical treatment. A second key characteristic of these pulses is their large bandwidth and high intensity, which allow for highly non-linear effects, including vibrational ladder climbing of surface vibrations. We derive general expressions relating the density matrix to SFG spectra, and apply these expressions to specific experimental results by solving the coupled optical Bloch equations of the density matrix elements. Thus, we can theoretically reproduce recent experimentally demonstrated hot band SFG spectra using fetmosecond broadband infrared excitation of carbon monoxide (CO) on a Ru(001) surface.},

Here, we investigate salt bridges between glutamate (Glu(-)) and arginine (Arg(+)) using two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy. The 2D-IR spectrum of a salt-bridged dimer shows cross peaks between the vibrational modes of Glu(-) and Arg(+), which provide a sensitive structural probe of Glu(-)⋯Arg(+) salt bridges. We use this probe to investigate a $\beta$-turn locked by a salt bridge, an $\alpha$-helical peptide whose structure is stabilized by salt bridges, and a coiled coil that is stabilized by intra- and intermolecular salt bridges. We detect a bidentate salt bridge in the $\beta$-turn, a monodentate one in the $\alpha$-helical peptide, and both salt-bridge geometries in the coiled coil. To our knowledge, this is the first time 2D-IR has been used to probe tertiary side chain interactions in peptides, and our results show that 2D-IR spectroscopy is a powerful method for investigating salt bridges in solution.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a series of small molecule probes with increasing alkyl chain length: water, methanol, and ethanol, diluted to low concentration in the room temperature ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, was investigated with 2D infrared vibrational echo (2D IR) spectroscopy and polarization resolved pump-probe (PP) experiments on the deuterated hydroxyl (O–D) stretching mode of each of the solutes. The long timescale spectral diffusion observed by 2D IR, capturing complete loss of vibrational frequency correlation through structural fluctuation of the medium, shows a clear but not dramatic slowing as the probe alkyl chain length is increased: 23 ps for water, 28 ps for methanol, and 34 ps for ethanol. Although in each case, only a single population of hydroxyl oscillators contributes to the infrared line shapes, the isotropic pump-probe decays (normally caused by population relaxation) are markedly nonexponential at short times. The early time features correspond to the timescales of the fast spectral diffusion measured with 2D IR. These fast isotropic pump-probe decays are produced by unequal pumping of the OD absorption band to a nonequilibrium frequency dependent population distribution caused by significant non-Condon effects. Orientational correlation functions for these three systems, obtained from pump-probe anisot-ropy decays, display several periods of restricted angular motion (wobbling-in-a-cone) followed by complete orientational randomization. The cone half-angles, which characterize the angular potential, become larger as the experimental frequency moves to the blue. These results indicate weakening of the angular potential with decreasing hydrogen bond strength. The slowest components of the orientational anisotropy decays are frequency-independent and correspond to the complete orienta-tional randomization of the solute molecule. These components slow appreciably with increasing chain length: 25 ps for water, 42 ps for methanol, and 88 ps for ethanol. The shape and volume of the probe, therefore, impact reorientation far more severely than they do spectral diffusion at long times, though these two processes occur on similar timescales at earlier times.

abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy can provide important information about structure and dynamics in liquids. In the case of liquid water, this is particularly true for isotopically dilute HOD/D2O and HOD/H2O systems. Infrared and Raman line shapes for these systems were measured some time ago. Very recently, ultrafast three-pulse vibrational echo experiments have been performed on these systems, which provide new, exciting, and important dynamical benchmarks for liquid water. There has been tremendous theoretical effort expended on the development of classical simulation models for liquid water. These models have been parameterized from experimental structural and thermodynamic measurements. The goal of this paper is to determine if representative simulation models are consistent with steady-state, and especially with these new ultrafast, experiments. Such a comparison provides information about the accuracy of the dynamics of these simulation models. We perform this comparison using theoretical methods developed in previous papers, and calculate the experimental observables directly, without making the Condon and cumulant approximations, and taking into account molecular rotation, vibrational relaxation, and finite excitation pulses. On the whole, the simulation models do remarkably well; perhaps the best overall agreement with experiment comes from the SPC/E model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Author(s). In this article, we report the study of structural and dynamical properties for a series of acetonitrile/propylammonium nitrate mixtures as a function of their composition. These systems display an unusual increase in intensity in their X-ray diffraction patterns in the low-q regime, and their 1 H-NMR diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) spectra display unusual diffusivities. However, the magnitude of both phenomena for mixtures of propylammonium nitrate is smaller than those observed for ethylammonium nitrate mixtures with the same cosolvent, suggesting that the cation alkyl tail plays an important role in these observations. The experimental X-ray scattering data are compared with the results of molecular dynamics simulations, including both ab initio studies used to interpret short-range interactions and classical simulations to describe longer range interactions. The higher level calculations highlight the presence of a strong hydrogen bond network within the ionic liquid, only slightly perturbed even at high acetonitrile concentration. These strong interactions lead to the symmetry breaking of the NO3- vibrations, with a splitting of about 88 cm -1 in the $\nu$ 3 antisymmetric stretch. The classical force field simulations use a greater number of ion pairs, but are not capable of fully describing the longest range interactions, although they do successfully account for the observed concentration trend, and the analysis of the models confirms the nano-inhomogeneity of these kinds of samples.},

abstract = {Using combined theoretical and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that the bond orientation of water at the water-vapor interface depends markedly on the water isotope (H-D) composition. While the interfacial water structures of H_{2}O and D_{2}O are indistinguishable, the intramolecular symmetry breaking in HDO is directly reflected at the surface: the OD bonds preferably orient down towards the bulk water, whereas the OH bond tends to orient up into the vapor phase. Path integral molecular dynamics simulations show good agreement with surface-specific sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy results, revealing that the distinct interfacial bond orientations originate from nuclear quantum effects. The enhanced localization of the heavier D atom leads to stronger hydrogen bonds, giving rise to OD bonds pointing down into the bulk.},

abstract = {This review presents a literature survey of recent work on poly(ionic liquid)s or polymerized ionic liquids (PILs), a class of polyelectrolytes that has attracted rapidly increasing interest over the past few years. The review begins with a short explanation of the interconnection as well as the intrinsic differences between PILs and ionic liquids. Recently reported PIL homopolymers with new chemical structures and synthetic trends are introduced as a complement to the overall PIL synthesis schemes reported previously. In addition, block copolymers and colloidal particles of PILs are described, followed by a discussion of the limitations of PILs due to structural instability under certain conditions and the efforts to understand PIL physics. Examples of recent applications of PILs across a multitude of fields, such as thermoresponsive materials, carbon materials, catalysis, porous polymers, separation and absorption materials, and energy harvesting/generation as well as several biological applications are described in detail. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Femtosecond two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy was carried out to study the dynamics of vibrational spectral diffusion of the nitrile stretching vibration of thiocyanate anions (S–CRN {\`{A}}) dissolved in liquid-to-supercritical heavy water (D 2 O). The 2DIR line shapes were used to extract through a nodal slope analysis quantitative information about the correlation function for temporal fluctuations of the CN-stretching frequency. The inverse nodal slope could be fitted phenomenologically by a simple double-exponential decay whose predominant component had a time constant ranging between 300 fs and 1 ps depending on the temperature. The temperature dependence is interpreted in terms of solvent structural fluctuations that are driven by the librational motions of the D 2 O molecules located in the first solvation shell of the anion. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations of the SCN {\`{A}} /D 2 O system indicate that the breaking and making of hydrogen-bonds between the terminal N-atom of the anion and the D 2 O molecules are induced by the same solvent-shell librational degrees of freedom that drive the vibrational line broadening dynamics seen in the 2DIR experiment.},

abstract = {We present computer simulation study of two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) of water confined in reverse micelles (RMs) of various sizes. The present study is motivated by the need to understand the altered dynamics of confined water by performing layerwise decomposition of water, with an aim to quantify the relative contributions of different layers water molecules to the calculated 2D-IR spectrum. The 0-1 transition spectra clearly show substantial elongation, due to inhomogeneous broadening and incomplete spectral diffusion, along the diagonal in the surface water layer of different sized RMs. Fitting of the frequency fluctuation correlation functions reveal that the motion of the surface water molecules is sub-diffusive and indicate the constrained nature of their dynamics. This is further supported by two peak nature of the angular analogue of van Hove correlation function. With increasing system size, the water molecules become more diffusive in nature and spectral diffusion almost completes in the central layer of the larger size RMs. Comparisons between experiments and simulations establish the correspondence between the spectral decomposition available in experiments with the spatial decomposition available in simulations. Simulations also allow a quantitative exploration of the relative role of water, sodium ions, and sulfonate head groups in vibrational dephasing. Interestingly, the negative cross correlation between force on oxygen and hydrogen of O-H bond in bulk water significantly decreases in the surface layer of each RM. This negative cross correlation gradually increases in the central water pool with increasing RMs size and this is found to be partly responsible for the faster relaxation rate of water in the central pool.},

Today, these solutes are known to display recurring behavior for myriad biological and chemical processes. Such behavior depends both on the nature and concentration of the species in solution. Despite the generality of these effects, our understanding of the molecular-level details of ion and osmolyte specificity is still quite limited. Here, we review recent studies of the interactions between anions and urea with model macromolecular systems. A mechanism for specific ion effects is elucidated for aqueous systems containing charged and uncharged polymers, polypeptides, and proteins. The results clearly show that the effects of the anions are local and involve direct interactions with macromolecules and their first hydration shell. Also, a hydrogen-bonding mechanism is tested for the urea denaturation of proteins with some of these same systems. In that case, direct hydrogen bonding can be largely discounted as the key mechanism for urea stabilization of uncollapsed and/or unfolded structures.},

abstract = {The simplest mixing problem corresponds to the mixing of a fluid with itself; this case provides a foundation on which the subject rests. The objective here is to study mixing independently of the mechanisms used to create the motion and review elements of theory focusing mostly on mathematical foundations and minimal models. The flows under consideration will be of two types: two-dimensional (2D) 'blinking flows', or three-dimensional (3D) duct flows. Given that mixing in continuous 3D duct flows depends critically on cross-sectional mixing, and that many microfluidic applications involve continuous flows, we focus on the essential aspects of mixing in 2D flows, as they provide a foundation from which to base our understanding of more complex cases. The baker's transformation is taken as the centrepiece for describing the dynamical systems framework. In particular, a hierarchy of characterizations of mixing exist, Bernoulli --> mixing --> ergodic, ordered according to the quality of mixing (the strongest first). Most importantly for the design process, we show how the so-called linked twist maps function as a minimal picture of mixing, provide a mathematical structure for understanding the type of 2D flows that arise in many micromixers already built, and give conditions guaranteeing the best quality mixing. Extensions of these concepts lead to first-principle-based designs without resorting to lengthy computations.},

All of the physiological characteristics of qE have been positively correlated with charge transfer between coupled chlorophyll and zeaxanthin molecules in the light- harvesting antenna of photosystem II ( PSII). We found evidence for charge- transfer quenching in all three of the individual minor antenna complexes of PSII ( CP29, CP26, and CP24), and we conclude that charge- transfer quenching in CP29 involves a delocalized state of an excitonically coupled chlorophyll dimer. We propose that reversible conformational changes in CP29 can "tune" the electronic coupling between the chlorophylls in this dimer, thereby modulating the energy of the chlorophyll-zeaxanthin charge- transfer state and switching on and off the charge- transfer quenching during qE.},

abstract = {Here we report on the structural and dynamical properties of a series of room temperature ionic liquids, namely 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{(trifluoromethane)sulfonyl}amide ([Cnmim][NTf2]), with varying alkyl chain lengths (1[?]n[?]10) at ambient temperature, where all the salts are stable liquids. Using small-wide angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS), three major diffraction peaks are found: two high- Q peaks that show little dependence on the alkyl chain length (n) and a low-Q peak that strongly depends both in amplitude and position on n. This low-Q peak is the signature of the occurrence of nanoscale structural heterogeneities whose sizes depend on the length of the alkyl chain and are related to chain segregation into nano-domains. Using optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy, we access intermolecular dynamic features that suggest that chain aggregation only occurs for n[?]3, in agreement with the SWAXS data. Moreover, the increase in the frequency and width of the main band of the optical Kerr effect spectra in going from n = 2 to 3 is consistent with stiffening of the intermolecular potential due to chain segregation. Multicomponent line shape analysis suggests that there are least three modes that underlie the main band in the 0-200 cm[?]1 region of the optical Kerr effect spectra of these ionic liquids. Given the similarity of ionic liquids to other complex fluid systems, we assign the low-frequency component to a fast b-relaxation mode and the intermediate- and high-frequency components to librational modes.},

abstract = {A thorough understanding of the microscopic mechanism of excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) and the influence of the solvent environment on its dynamics are of great fundamental interest. We present here a detailed investigation of an ESPT to solvent (DMSO) using time-resolved broadband fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopies. All excited-state species are resolved spectrally and kinetically using a global target analysis based on the two-step Eigen-Weller model. Reversibility of the initial short-range proton transfer producing excited contact ion pairs (CIP*) is observed unambiguously in fluorescence and must be explicitly considered to obtain the individual rate constants. Close inspection of the early dynamics suggests that the relative populations of the protonated form (ROH*) and CIP* are governed by solvent relaxation that influences the relative energies of the excited states. This constitutes a breakdown of the Eigen-Weller model, although the overall agreement between the data and...},

abstract = {Modified Cu electrodes were prepared by annealing Cu foil in air and electrochemically reducing the resulting Cu(2)O layers. The CO(2) reduction activities of these electrodes exhibited a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the Cu(2)O layer. Thin Cu(2)O layers formed by annealing at 130 °C resulted in electrodes whose activities were indistinguishable from those of polycrystalline Cu. In contrast, Cu(2)O layers formed at 500 °C that were ≥$\sim$3 $\mu$m thick resulted in electrodes that exhibited large roughness factors and required 0.5 V less overpotential than polycrystalline Cu to reduce CO(2) at a higher rate than H(2)O. The combination of these features resulted in CO(2) reduction geometric current densities >1 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials <0.4 V, a higher level of activity than all previously reported metal electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. Moreover, the activity of the modified electrodes was stable over the course of several hours, whereas a polycrystalline Cu electrode exhibited deactivation within 1 h under identical conditions. The electrodes described here may be particularly useful for elucidating the structural properties of Cu that determine the distribution between CO(2) and H(2)O reduction and provide a promising lead for the development of practical catalysts for electrolytic fuel synthesis.},

By probing the vibrational resonances of the photoacid, the accepting base, and the hydrated proton we find that intermolecular PT in this model system involves the transfer of the proton across several water molecules linking the donor-acceptor pair by hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). We find that at high base concentration the rate of PT is not determined by the mutual diffusion of acid and base but rather by the rate of Grotthuss-like conduction of the proton between molecules. This long-range PT requires an activated solvent configuration to facilitate the charge transfer.},

The distances among SCN(-) anions in KSCN crystals and ion clusters of KSCN aqueous solutions were determined with the method. In the crystalline samples, the closest anion distance was determined to be 3.9 ± 0.3 {\AA}, consistent with the XRD result. In the 1.8 and 1 M KSCN aqueous solutions, the anion distances in the ion clusters were determined to be 4.4 ± 0.4 {\AA}. The clustered anion distances in aqueous solutions are very similar to the closest anion distance in the KSCN crystal but significantly shorter than the average anion distance (0.94-1.17 nm) in the aqueous solutions if ion clustering did not occur. The result suggests that ions in the strong electrolyte aqueous solutions can form clusters inside of which they have direct contact with each other.},

Modeling of the bonding of acetate and formate in aqueous solution to a range of cations was used to predict the infrared spectra of the metal-carboxylate complexes, and the wavenumbers of the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational modes are reported. Furthermore, we have shown that these shifts in wavenumber occur primarily due to how bonding with the metal changes the carboxylate C-O bond lengths and O-C-O angle.},

The diffraction patterns show two distinct peaks appeared at scattering vectors Q of 0.3 and 1.0 {\AA}–1. The former originates from the nanoscale structure characteristic to ionic liquids and the latter due to the interionic correlations. Interestingly, the intensity of the low-Q peak drastically grows upon cooling and keeps growing even below the glass transition temperature. The NSE measurements have been performed at these two Q positions, to explore the time evolution of each correlation. The relaxation related to the ionic correlation (ionic diffusion) is of Arrhenius-type and exhibits nonexponential behavior. The activation energy (Ea) of the ionic diffusion, which is linked to viscosity, depends on the type of anion; the larger is the anion size, the smaller Ea becomes for most of anions. On the other hand, two kinds of relaxation processes, slower and faster ones, are found at the low-Q peak position. The most significant finding is that the fraction of the slower relaxation increases and that of the faster one decreases upon cooling. Combining the NSE data with the diffraction data, we conclude that there exist two parts in ILs: one with the ordered nanostructure exhibiting the slow relaxation, and the other with disordered structure showing faster relaxation. The structure and dynamics of ILs are heterogeneous in nature, and the fraction of each part changes with temperature.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of recent experiments and theoretical developments aimed at using vibrational spectroscopy to understand the structure and dynamics of nitrile-labeled biomolecules. Nitrile groups are excellent vibrational probes of proteins and DNA because they absorb in a region of the spectrum that is relatively free of absorption due to the biomolecule, and they have high extinction coefficients. The vibrational frequency of nitrile groups is also extraordinarily sensitive to its local environment, and thus C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N bonds have been employed in both linear and 2-D infrared (IR) spectroscopy experiments and also as vibrational Stark probes of electric fields in proteins. The interpretation and design of these experiments would be enhanced by accurate calculations of IR spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. Recently, theoretical developments towards computing the vibrational spectrum of nitrile groups in the condensed-phase have been highly successful. A strong synergy between experiment and theory will further promote the use of vibrational spectroscopy of nitrile-labeled biomolecules to address fundamental questions of structure and dynamics that are elusive to other techniques.},

Orientational relaxation and population relaxation are observed for w(0) = 2, 4, and 7.5 in both solvents using IR pump-probe measurements. It is found that the pump-probe observables are sensitive to w(0), but not to the solvent. However, initial analysis of the vibrational echo data from the water nanopool in the reverse micelles in the isooctane solvent seems to yield different dynamics than the CCl(4) system in spite of the fact that the spectra, vibrational lifetimes, and orientational relaxation are the same in the two systems. It is found that there are beat patterns in the interferograms with isooctane as the solvent. The beats are observed from a signal generated by the AOT/isooctane system even when there is no water in the system. A beat subtraction data processing procedure does a reasonable job of removing the distortions in the isooctane data, showing that the reverse micelle dynamics are the same within experimental error regardless of whether isooctane or carbon tetrachloride is used as the organic phase. Two time scales are observed in the vibrational echo data, $\sim$1 and $\sim$10 ps. The slower component contains a significant amount of the total inhomogeneous broadening. Physical arguments indicate that there is a much slower component of spectral diffusion that is too slow to observe within the experimental window, which is limited by the OD stretch vibrational lifetime.},

The ILs studied were ethylammonium formate (EAF), ethylammonium nitrate (EAN), propylammonium formate (PAF), propylammonium nitrate (PAN), dimethylethylammonium formate (DMEAF), and ethanolammonium nitrate (EtAN). ILs were confined between a silica colloid probe and a mica surface, and the friction force was measured as a function of normal load for sliding velocities between 10 and 40 $\mu$m s(-1). At low normal forces, multiple IL layers are found between the probe and the surface, but at higher force, in the boundary layer regime, a single ion layer separates the probe and the surface. In the boundary layer regime energy is dissipated by two main pathways. Firstly, the ionic liquid near the surface, with the exception of the boundary layer, is expelled from the advancing contact made by the probe on the surface. This disruption in the interactions between the boundary layer and the near surface multilayers, leads to energy dissipation and depends on the strength of the attraction between the boundary and near surface layers. The second pathway is via rotations and twists of ions in the boundary layer, primarily associated with the cation terminal methyl group. The friction coefficient did not vary over the limited range of sliding speeds investigated.},

With this improvement, ionic liquid mixtures become a good alternative - when using the TDCR-Cherenkov technique - to standardize radionuclides having electron emissions energies close to the threshold energy in water (∼ 260keV). As an advantage compared with other solvents, the Ionic liquid mixture can be reused, in the case of short-lived radionuclides, by simply removing all water content in a vacuum oven.},

abstract = {The potential for femtosecond to picosecond time-scale motions to influence the rate of the intrinsic chemical step in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is a source of significant controversy. Among the central challenges in resolving this controversy is the difficulty of experimentally characterizing thermally activated motions at this time scale in functionally relevant enzyme complexes. We report a series of measurements to address this problem using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to characterize the time scales of active-site motions in complexes of formate dehydrogenase with the transition-state-analog inhibitor azide (N(3)(-)). We observe that the frequency-frequency time correlation functions (FFCF) for the ternary complexes with NAD(+) and NADH decay completely with slow time constants of 3.2 ps and 4.6 ps, respectively. This result suggests that in the vicinity of the transition state, the active-site enzyme structure samples a narrow and relatively rigid conformational distribution indicating that the transition-state structure is well organized for the reaction. In contrast, for the binary complex, we observe a significant static contribution to the FFCF similar to what is seen in other enzymes, indicating the presence of the slow motions that occur on time scales longer than our measurement window.},

abstract = {Rearrangements of the hydrogen bond network of liquid water are believed to involve rapid and concerted hydrogen bond switching events, during which a hydrogen bond donor molecule undergoes large angle molecular reorientation as it exchanges hydrogen bonding partners. To test this picture of hydrogen bonddynamics, we have performed ultrafast 2D IR spectralanisotropy measurements on the OH stretching vibration of HOD in D2O to directly track the reorientation of water molecules as they change hydrogen bonding environments. Interpretation of the experimental data is assisted by modeling drawn from molecular dynamics simulations, and we quantify the degree of molecular rotation on changing local hydrogen bonding environment using restricted rotation models. From the inertial 2D anisotropy decay, we find that water molecules initiating from a strained configuration and relaxing to a stable configuration are characterized by a distribution of angles, with an average reorientation half-angle of 10°, implying an average reorientation for a full switch of ≥20°. These results provide evidence that water hydrogen bond network connectivity switches through concerted motions involving large angle molecular reorientation.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) with aprotic heterocyclic anions, or "AHAs," can bind CO2 with reaction enthalpies that are suitable for gas separations, and without suffering large viscosity increases. In the present work, we have synthesized ILs bearing an alkyl-phosphonium cation with indazolide, imidazolide, pyrrolide, pyrazolide and triazolide-based anions that span a wide range of predicted reaction enthalpies with CO2. Each AHA-based IL was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their physical properties (viscosity, glass transition, and thermal decomposition temperature) determined. In addition, the influence of substituent groups on the reaction enthalpy was investigated by measuring the CO2 solubility in each IL at pressures between 0 and 1 bar at 22 °C using a volumetric method. The isotherm-derived enthalpies range between -37 and -54 kJ mol-1 of CO2, and these values are in good agreement with computed enthalpies of gas-phase IL-CO2 reaction products from molecular electronic structure calculations. The AHA ILs show no substantial increase in viscosity when fully saturated with CO2 at 1 bar. Phase splitting and compositional analysis of one of the IL/H2O and IL/H2O/CO2 systems conclude that protonation of the 2-cyanopyrrolide anion is improbable, and this result was confirmed by the equimolar CO2 absorption in the presence of water. Taking advantage of the tunable binding energy and absence of viscosity increase after the reaction with CO2, AHA ILs are promising candidates for efficient and environmental-friendly absorbents in post-combustion CO2 capture.},

Three microregions were identified by conductivity measurements according to the percolation theory. The sizes of IL-in-oil microemulsions with various IL fractions were then determined by NMR and DLS and were found to be in accordance with the radii of gyration (approximately 2 or 3 nm) determined by SANS. The reverse IL-in-oil microemulsions were used as nanoreactors to perform a Matsuda-Heck reaction between p-methoxyphenyl diazonium salt and 2,3-dihydrofurane in the presence of a palladium catalyst. The reaction yields obtained were greater in microemulsions (67%) than in bulk IL (33%), highlighting a strong effect of confinement. Moreover, a direct correlation between the quantity of IL and the reaction yield was observed.},

abstract = {Examination of nature's favorite molecules reveals a striking preference for making carbon-heteroatom bonds over carbon-carbon bonds-surely no surprise given that carbon dioxide is nature's starting material and that most reactions are performed in water. Nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides are condensation polymers of small subunits stitched together by carbon-heteroatom bonds. Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call "click chemistry". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect "spring-loaded" reactions. The stringent criteria for a process to earn click chemistry status are described along with examples of the molecular frameworks that are easily made using this spartan, but powerful, synthetic strategy.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an alternative method to determine the concentrations of metal cations in aqueous solutions, using area integration of proton NMR spectra of EDTA (the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) metal complexes. Using this method, a certain volume of unknown metal cation solution is added to an excess amount of standard EDTA solution, and the ratio of the remaining free EDTA and the EDTA–metal complex in the solution can be calculated from the integration areas of the proton NMR spectra. Unlike the conventional complexometric titration, where indicators need to be used to determine the endpoint, this NMR method aims to provide a simple method to eliminate the need for using indicators. This method, when EDTA is used as the standard, is valid for determining the concentrations of nonparamagnetic transition and rare earth metal cations, and for the concentrations of group IIIA and IVA metal cations.},

abstract = {Sum frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS), a second-order optical process, is interface-specific in the dipole approximation [ Perry , A. ; Neipert , C. ; Moore , P. ; Space , B. Chem. Rev. 2006 , 106 , 1234 - 1258 ; Richmond , G. L. Chem. Rev. 2002 , 102 , 2693 - 2724 ; Byrnes , S. J. ; Geissler , P. L. ; Shen , Y. R. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2011 , 516 , 115 - 124 ]. At charged interfaces, the experimentally detected signal is a combination of enhanced second-order and static-field-induced third-order contributions due to the existence of a static field. Evidence of the importance/relative magnitude of this third-order contribution is seen in the literature [ Ong , S. ; Zhao , X. ; Eisenthal , K. B. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1992 , 191 , 327 - 335 ; Zhao , X. ; Ong , S. ; Eisenthal , K. B. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1993 , 202 , 513 - 520 ; Shen , Y. R. Appl. Phys. B: Laser Opt. 1999 , 68 , 295 - 300 ], but a molecularly detailed approach to separately calculating the second- and third-order contributions is difficult to construct. Recent work presented a novel molecular dynamics (MD)-based theory that provides a direct means to calculate the third-order contributions to SFVS spectra at charged interfaces [ Neipert , C. ; Space , B. J. Chem. Phys. 2006 , 125 , 224706 ], and a hyperpolarizability model for water was developed as a prerequisite to practical implementation [ Neipert , C. ; Space , B. Comput. Lett. 2007 , 3 , 431 - 440 ]. Here, these methods are applied to a highly abstracted/idealized silica/water interface, and the results are compared to experimental data for water at a fused quartz surface. The results suggest that such spectra have some quite general spectral features.},

When hot it is a normal simple liquid; however, close to ambient temperatures properties, such as the compressibility, begin to deviate and do so increasingly on further cooling. Clearly, these emerging properties are connected to its ability to form up to four well-defined hydrogen bonds allowing for different local structural arrangements. A wealth of new data from various experiments and simulations has recently become available. When taken together they point to a heterogeneous picture with fluctuations between two classes of local structural environments developing on temperature-dependent length scales.},

Originally, it was thought that an ion's influence on macromolecular properties was caused at least in part by 'making' or 'breaking' bulk water structure. Recent time-resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect. Instead, models are being developed that depend upon direct ion-macromolecule interactions as well as interactions with water molecules in the first hydration shell of the macromolecule. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlated electron-hole pairs (excitons) are accessed spectroscopically through their allowed single-quantum transitions, but higher-order correlations that may strongly influence electronic and optical properties have been far more elusive to study. Here we report direct observation of bound exciton pairs (biexcitons) that provide incisive signatures of four-body correlations among electrons and holes in gallium arsenide (GaAs) quantum wells. Four distinct, mutually coherent, ultrashort optical pulses were used to create coherent exciton states, transform these successively into coherent biexciton states and then new radiative exciton states, and finally to read out the radiated signals, yielding biexciton binding energies through a technique closely analogous to multiple-quantum two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D FT) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A measured variation of the biexciton dephasing rate indicated still higher-order correlations. E},

The ATR spectrum in the CHx (x = 1, 2, 3) vibration region from 2800 to 3200 cm-1 was very different between [BMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][I] even though all the spectral features in this region were from the butyl chain and the imidazolium ring of the same cation. The spectrum did not change appreciably irrespective of the water concentration for [BMIM][BF4], whereas the spectrum from [BMIM][I] showed significant changes as the water concentration was increased, especially in CH-vibration modes from the imidazolium ring. For very diluted solutions both aqueous mixtures of [BMIM][I] and [BMIM][BF4] showed very similar spectra. Mixing of [BMIM][I] with heavy water (D2O) facilitated the isotopic exchange of the proton attached to the most acidic carbon of the imidazolium ring into deuterium from D2O, whereas even prolonged exposure to D2O did not induce any isotopic exchange for [BMIM][BF4]. Raman spectra around 600 cm(-1) indicative of the butyl chain conformation also changed differently as the water concentration was increased between [BMIM][I] and [BMIM][BF4]. These differences are considered to come from the variation in the position of the anion, where I- is expected to be closer to the C(2) hydrogen of the imidazolium cation and interacting more specifically as compared to BF(4-).},

abstract = {The dynamics of water are examined using ultrafast IR stimulated vibrational echo correlation spectroscopy. The OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O is probed with 45-fs pulses that have sufficient bandwidth (>400 cm-1) to span the entire broad spectrum. High-quality 2D correlation spectra are obtained having the correct phase relations across the broad hydroxyl band. The correlation spectra are found to evolve on multiple time scales. The time evolution of the vibrational echo correlation spectrum reflects the structural evolution of the hydrogen bond networks. The extended vibrational lifetime of the OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O facilitates the measurement of hydrogen bond dynamics for longer times than possible in previous studies of the OH stretch. Molecular dynamics simulations/electronic structure calculations are used to obtain the time correlation functions (TCF) for two water models, TIP4P and SPC/E. The TCFs are inputs to full time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation theory calculations, which yield theoretical correlation spectra. Quantitative comparison with the data demonstrates that the two water models somewhat overemphasize the fast fluctuations in water and do not contain a slow enough component to account for the slowest fluctuations. Fits to the data using a phenomenological triexponential TCF yield a slowest component of ∼2 ps, and TIP4P and SPC/E have slowest components of <1 ps. The TCF obtained from the water models and the triexponential TCF reproduce the linear absorption line shape equally well, but all miss to some extent the asymmetric “wing” on the low-energy side of the line. Therefore, the time dependence of the vibrational echo correlation spectra provides a good test for the TCF, but the absorption spectrum does not.},

abstract = {Vibrational and electronic transition dipole strengths are often good probes of molecular structures, especially in excitonically coupled systems of chromophores. One cannot determine transition dipole strengths using linear spectroscopy unless the concentration is known, which in many cases it is not. In this paper, we report a simple method for measuring transition dipole moments from linear absorption and 2D IR spectra that does not require knowledge of concentrations. Our method is tested on several model compounds and applied to the amide I(') band of a polypeptide in its random coil and $\alpha$-helical conformation as modulated by the solution temperature. It is often difficult to confidently assign polypeptide and protein secondary structures to random coil or $\alpha$-helix by linear spectroscopy alone, because they absorb in the same frequency range. We find that the transition dipole strength of the random coil state is 0.12 ± 0.013 D(2), which is similar to a single peptide unit, indicating that the vibrational mode of random coil is localized on a single peptide unit. In an $\alpha$-helix, the lower bound of transition dipole strength is 0.26 ± 0.03 D(2). When taking into account the angle of the amide I(') transition dipole vector with respect to the helix axis, our measurements indicate that the amide I(') vibrational mode is delocalized across a minimum of 3.5 residues in an $\alpha$-helix. Thus, one can confidently assign secondary structure based on exciton delocalization through its effect on the transition dipole strength. Our method will be especially useful for kinetically evolving systems, systems with overlapping molecular conformations, and other situations in which concentrations are difficult to determine.},

abstract = {We study the mechanism of proton transfer (PT) in the aqueous acid-base reaction between the photoacid 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid (HPTS) and acetate by probing the vibrational resonances of HPTS, acetate, and the hydrated proton with ferntosecond mid-infrared laser pulses. We find that PT takes place in a distribution of hydrogen-bound reaction complexes that differ in the number of water molecules separating the acid and the base. The number of intervening water molecules ranges from 0 to 5, which, together with a strongly distance-dependent PT rate, explains the observed highly nonexponential reaction kinetics. The kinetic isotope effect for the reaction is determined to be 1.5, indicating that tunneling does not play a significant role in the transfer of the proton. Rather, the transfer mechanism is best described in terms of the adiabatic PT picture as it has been formulated by Hynes and co-workers [Staib, A.; Borgis, D.; Hynes, J. T. J. Chem. Phys. 1995, 102, 2487. Ando, K.; Hynes, J. T. J. Phys. Chem.

abstract = {Vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study interfaces. Recently, multiplex heterodyne-detected VSFG (HD-VSFG) has been developed, which enables the direct measurement of complex second-order nonlinear susceptibility [$\chi$((2))]. HD-VSFG has remarkable advantages over conventional VSFG. For example, the imaginary part of $\chi$((2)) [Im$\chi$((2))] obtained with this interferometric technique is the direct counterpart to the infrared [Im$\chi$((1))] and Raman [Im$\chi$((3))] spectra in the bulk, and it is free from the spectral deformation inevitable in conventional VSFG [|$\chi$((2))|(2)] spectra. The Im$\chi$((2)) signal is obtained with a sign that contains unambiguous information about the up/down orientation of interfacial molecules. Furthermore, HD-VSFG can be straightforwardly extended to time-resolved measurements when combined with photoexcitation. In this review, we describe the present status of experiments and applications of multiplex HD-VSFG spectroscopy, in particular with regard to the orientation and structure of interfacial water at charged, neutral, and biorelevant water interfaces.},

Diffusion data were measured using the pulsed gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) experiment for surfactant molecules residing in the RM interface. Inverse Laplace transformation of these data generated diffusion coefficients for the RMs, which were converted into hydrodynamic radii using the Stokes-Einstein relation. This technique is complementary to those previously used to size RMs, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), but also offers several advantages, which are discussed. RM sizes, determined using the PGSTE method, in the AOT (sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate) and CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) microemulsions were compared with previous DLS and SAXS data, showing good agreement. Methods for determining number distributions from the PGSTE data, through the use of scaling factors, were investigated.},

abstract = {Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) from fossil fuel power plants by reactive absorption can substantially contribute to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2. To test new solvents for this purpose small pilot plants are used. The present paper describes results of comprehensive studies of the standard PCC solvent MEA (0.3g/g monoethanolamine in water) in a pilot plant in which the closed cycle of absorption/desorption process is continuously operated (column diameters: 0.125m, absorber/desorber packing height: 4.25/2.55m, packing type: Sulzer BX 500, flue gas flow: 30-110kg/h, CO2 partial pressure: 35-135mbar). The data establish a base line for comparisons with new solvents tested in the pilot plant and can be used for a validation of models of the PCC process with MEA. The ratio of the solvent to the flue gas mass flow is systematically varied at constant CO2 removal rate, and CO2 partial pressure in the flue gas. Optimal operating points are determined. In the present study the structured packing Sulzer BX 500 is used. The experiments with the removal rate variation are carried out so that the results can directly be compared to those from a previous study in the same plant that was carried out using Sulzer Mellapak 250.Y. A strategy for identifying the influence of absorption kinetics on the results is proposed, which is based on a variation of the gas load at a constant L/G ratio and provides valuable insight on the transferability of pilot plant results. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

@article{Marx1999b,
abstract = {Explanations for the anomalously high mobility of protons in liquid water began with Grotthuss's idea of 'structural diffusion' nearly two centuries ago. Subsequent explanations have refined this concept by invoking thermal hopping, proton tunnelling or solvation effects. More recently, two main structural models have emerged for the hydrated proton. Eigen proposed the formation of an H9O4 complex in which an H3O core is strongly hydrogen-bonded to three H2O molecules. Zundel, meanwhile, supported the notion of an H5O2/+ complex in which the proton is shared between two H2O molecules. Here we use ab initio path integral simulations to address this question. These simulations include time-independent equilibrium thermal and quantum fluctuations of all nuclei, and determine interatomic interactions from the electronic structure. We find that the hydrated proton forms a fluxional defect in the hydrogenbonded network, with both H9O4 and H5O2/+ occurring only in the sense of 'limiting' or 'ideal' structures. The defect can become delocalized over several hydrogen bonds owing to quantum fluctuations. Solvent polarization induces a small barrier to proton transfer, which is washed out by zero-point motion. The proton can consequently be considered part of a 'low-barrier hydrogen bond, in which tunnelling is negligible and the simplest concepts of transition-state theory do not apply. The rate of proton diffusion is determined by thermally induced hydrogen-bond breaking in the second solvation shell.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) exhibit unique features such as low melting points, low vapor pressures, wide liquidus temperature ranges, high thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and wide electrochemical windows. As a result, they show promise for use in variety of applications: as reaction media, in batteries and supercapacitors, in solar and fuel cells, for electrochemical deposition of metals and semiconductors, for protein extraction and crystallization, and many others. Because of the ease with which they can be supercooled, ionic liquids offer new opportunities to investigate long-standing questions regarding the nature of the dynamic glass transition and its possible link to charge transport. Despite the significant steps achieved from experimental and theoretical studies, no generally accepted quantitative theory of dynamic glass transition to date has been capable of reproducing all the experimentally observed features. In this Account, we discuss recent studies of the interplay between charge transport and glassy dynamics in ionic liquids as investigated by a combination of several experimental techniques including broadband dielectric spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Based on Einstein-Smoluchowski relations, we use dielectric spectra of ionic liquids to determine diffusion coefficients in quantitative agreement with independent pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, but spanning a broader range of more than 10 orders of magnitude. This approach provides a novel opportunity to determine the electrical mobility and effective number density of charge carriers as well as their types of thermal activation from the measured dc conductivity separately. We also unravel the origin of the remarkable universality of charge transport in different classes of glass-forming ionic liquids.},

Since there are already many reviews on benefits of ILs, after a very brief review of ILs we focus mostly on aspects that are not covered in other reviews, in particular the known limits of these solvents. In addition, different methods to measure the physicochemical properties relevant to their use in energy storage applications such as fuel cells and batteries are introduced. The physicochemical properties that are reviewed are thermal properties, conductivity and chemical reactivity. The focus of the review is on the literature after 2008, with the exception of some important historic articles on ILs.},

G protein-coupled receptors initiate complex, interrelated downstream signaling cascades, whereas rapid ionic flux through channels directly supports membrane excitability and mediates cellular functions through second messengers. Because of these characteristics, these ubiquitous transmembrane proteins are valuable therapeutic targets and have provided fertile ground for the development of leading-edge synthetic and chemical biological approaches. Here we summarize recent advances in the use of site-directed incorporation of unnatural amino acids and chemical probes to study ligand-receptor interactions, determine the location of binding sites, and examine the downstream conformational consequences of ligand binding in G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels.},

The technique has the advantage that only a single sample surface need be polished, and no thickness measurement is necessary. The reflectance spectrum is analyzed by Kramers-Kronig relations or classical oscillator analysis to yield the optical constants and the absorption coefficient at 2350 cm(-1), due to the asymmetric stretching (v(3)) vibration of molecular CO2. The value obtained is in excellent agreement with values obtained by the transmission FTIR technique for a suite of rhyolitic glasses. For practical application of the method to rhyolites, an empirical correlation is developed between the normalized change in reflectance at 2350 cm(-1) and the CO2 content, up to similar to 0.40 wt%.

abstract = {The anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industries and power plants have been accepted as a dominant contributor to the recent changes in the global climate. One of the technologies that have been recently developed to tackle CO2 emission is post-combustion capture. To meet the accelerated development in this technology, more effective absorbents are required to reduce energy consumption, capture cost, and equipment footprint in CO2 capture processes. Ionic liquids (ILs) are regarded as potential alternative absorbents, due to their intrinsic properties, such as low volatility, low corrosivity, thermal stability, tunability, and high CO2 affinity at elevated pressures. CO2 solubilities in traditional ILs are relatively low under ambient conditions compared with amine-based absorbents, leading to the development of ILs bearing functional moieties or polymeric groups with improved and larger capacities for CO2. These developments include amine groups, amino acid groups, superbases, aprotic heterocyclic anions as well as transition metal ions, promoting chemical interactions with CO2. IL entities have also been tailored with polymerisable groups to create polymerised-ILs which are less energy intensive and highly selective in CO2 capture processes. This chapter reviews the IL absorbents having different types of CO2-philic groups, and discusses their reaction mechanisms with CO2. Not all chemically modified ILs preserve the original advantageous properties of conventional ILs; some modified ILs become highly viscous while some become volatile, and some become moisture or air sensitive. Therefore, the benefits and drawbacks of using these IL absorbents for CO2 capture are also addressed.},

Here we report the first ultrafast liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of solvated electrons in liquid water. The results prove unequivocally the existence of solvated electrons bound at the water surface and of solvated electrons in the bulk solution, with vertical binding energies of 1.6 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively, and with lifetimes longer than 100 ps. The unexpectedly long lifetime of solvated electrons bound at the water surface is attributed to a free-energy barrier that separates surface and interior states. Beyond constituting important energetic and kinetic benchmark and reference data, the results also help to understand the mechanisms of a number of very efficient electron-transfer processes in nature.},

The phase diagram of the precursor mixtures, thus obtained, consisted of a wide isotropic amorphous region, crystal + amorphous coexistence region at high lithium salt concentrations and plastic crystal + amorphous coexistence region at succinonitrile-rich compositions. Of particular interest is that upon photo-polymerization of isotropic compositions, the resulting networks remained completely amorphous without undergoing polymerization-induced phase separation or polymerization-induced crystallization. The ionic conductivity was mapped out as a function of composition within the isotropic region of the starting ternary phase diagram in conjunction with room temperature conductivities showing high ionic conductivities on the order of 10- 3 S cm- 1 at several compositions. These solid state polymer electrolyte membranes are transparent, light weight, and flexible, which can be shaped in any forms with space saving attributes. More importantly, no solvent is required in the membrane fabrication as well as in the battery operation, thereby improving safety and cost effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The hypotheses that ionic liquids are structurally heterogeneous at the molecular level and, even further, that this heterogeneity can transfer to the rates of reactions run in ionic liquids is being actively debated. Here, this hypothesis is tested using multiple population-period transient spectroscopy (MUPPETS), an emerging type of multidimensional measurement that resolves the kinetics of subensembles within a heterogeneous sample. A previous MUPPETS study of the excited-state twisting and electronic relaxation of auramine indicated that an ionic-liquid solvent induces rate dispersion due to a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous processes, but those data could not quantitatively separate these contributions [Khurmi, C.; Berg, M. A. J. Phys. Chem. Lett.2010, 1, 161]. New MUPPETS data that include phase resolution and subtraction of thermal gratings are presented here and are successfully modeled. The total range of reaction rates (10–90%) is a factor of 70. If the solvent effect is viewed as a set of local viscosities, the viscosity distribution is broad and highly asymmetric. However, if the solvent is viewed as changing a reaction barrier, the data correspond to a Gaussian distribution of barrier heights. The relaxation of each subensemble is nonexponential with an initial induction period, but the shape of the decay is invariant across the rate distribution. A small (2%), long-lived component is identified as a part of the homogeneous kinetic scheme and thus as a secondary channel for excited-state relaxation, not as an impurity or alternative ground-state form of auramine. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the primary cause of rate heterogeneity is a long-lived local electric field acting on the charge redistribution during the reaction.},

The quasireversible cyclic voltammetric wave observed at -0.58 V vs SCE at a Pt electrode was originally proposed to correspond to reduction of pyrH(+) to pyridinyl radical (pyrH(•)). This mechanistic explanation for the observed electrochemistry seems unlikely in light of recent quantum mechanical calculations that predict a very negative reduction potential (-1.37 V vs SCE) for the formation of pyrH(•). Several other mechanisms have been proposed to account for the discrepancy in calculated and observed reduction potentials, including surface adsorption of pyrH(•), reduction of pyrH(+) by two electrons rather than one, and reduction of the pyrH(+) proton to a surface hydride rather than a $\pi$-based radical product. This final mechanism, which can be described as inner-sphere reduction of pyrH(+) to form a surface hydride, is consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {Vibrational Stark effects, which are the effects of electric fields on vibrational spectra, were measured for the C−N stretch mode of several small nitriles. Samples included unconjugated and conjugated nitriles, and mono- and dinitriles. They were immobilized in frozen 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran glass and analyzed in externally applied electric fields using an FTIR; details of the methodology are presented. Difference dipole moments, $\Delta$$\mu$, equivalent to the linear Stark tuning rate, range from 0.01/f to 0.04/f Debye (0.2/f to 0.7/f cm-1/(MV/cm)) for most samples, with aromatic compounds toward the high end and symmetric dinitriles toward the low end (the local field correction factor, f, is expected to be similar for all these samples). Most quadratic Stark effects are small and negative, while transition polarizabilities are positive and have a significant effect on Stark line shapes. For aromatic nitriles, transition dipoles and $\Delta$$\mu$ values correlate with Hammett numbers. Symmetric dinitrile $\Delta$$\mu$ values decrease monotonically with increasing conjugation of the connecting bridge, likely due to improved mechanical coupling and, to a lesser extent, an increased population of inversion symmetric conformations. $\Delta$$\mu$ values are close to those expected from bond anharmonicity and ab initio predictions.},

abstract = {Semiclassical approximations to response functions can allow the calculation of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic observables from classical dynamics. Evaluating a canonical response function requires the related tasks of determining thermal weights for initial states and computing the dynamics of these states. A class of approximations for vibrational response functions employs classical trajectories at quantized values of action variables and represents the effects of the radiation-matter interaction by discontinuous transitions. Here, we evaluate choices for a thermal weight function which are consistent with this dynamical approximation. Weight functions associated with different semiclassical approximations are compared, and two forms are constructed which yield the correct linear response function for a harmonic potential at any temperature and are also correct for anharmonic potentials in the classical mechanical limit of high temperature. Approximations to the vibrational linear response function with quantized classical trajectories and proposed thermal weight functions are assessed for ensembles of one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators. This approach is shown to perform well for an anharmonic potential that is not locally harmonic over a temperature range encompassing the quantum limit of a two-level system and the limit of classical dynamics.},

abstract = {We carried out classical molecular dynamics simulations with a standard and two quantum chemistry based charge sets to study the ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C(4)C(1)im][Br]. We split the cation up into different charge groups and found that the total charge and the charge distribution in the imidazolium ring are completely different in the three systems while the total charge of the butyl chain is much better conserved between the methods. For comparison, the spatial distribution functions and the radial distribution functions as well as different time correlation functions were calculated. For the structural properties we obtained a good agreement between the standard and one of the two quantum chemistry based sets, while the results from the second quantum chemistry based set led to a completely different picture. The opposite was observed for the dynamic properties, which agree well between the standard set and the second quantum chemistry based set, whereas the dynamics in the first charge set obtained by quantum chemistry calculations proceeded much too slow, which is not obvious from the total charge. We observed, that the structure of the butyl chain is mostly unaffected by the choice of the charge set. This is an indirect proof for separation into ionic parts and nonpolar domains. A second focus of the article is the investigation of dynamical heterogeneity and the ion cages. Therefore, we analyzed the reorientational dynamics in the three systems and at five different temperatures in system with the standard charge set. Generally speaking, we detected four different time domains. The fastest movement can be found for the continuous hydrogen bond and the nearest neighbor ion pair dynamics. In the second time domain the movement of the butyl chain took place. The third time domain consisted in the increasing movement of the imidazolium ring as well as in the continuous distortion of an ion cage, i.e., the departure of one of the several counterions from the central ion's first shell, and the intermittent hydrogen bond dynamics. The remaining domain involves the translational displacement of the ions.},

abstract = {The structure fluctuations of the peptide bond interacting with solvent are examined through the coupling and correlations of the frequency distributions of amide I and amide II transitions. The fluctuations of the two modes are anticorrelated as a result of the solvent-induced changes in the mixing of the dominant valence-bond structures of the peptide. Significant anharmonic coupling of the two modes is seen. The results are the application of a new approach to two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy in which the pulse sequences used to produce the vibrational echoes incorporate two frequencies. This dual-frequency arrangement greatly extends the capabilities of 2D-IR spectroscopy by allowing the coupling between widely separated modes to be characterized in analogy with heteronuclear NMR. The experiment exposes the cross peaks, representing the mode coupling, free of the interference of the strong diagonal peaks that typically dominate 2D-IR spectroscopy. The alignment and dephasing of coupled transitions, in this example the amide I and amide II transition dipoles, is also determined by these experiments.},

abstract = {The long time scale orientational relaxation of nematogens in the isotropic phase is associated with the randomization of pseudonematic domains, which have a correlation length that grows as the isotropic-to-nematic phase transition temperature is approached from above. Here we begin to address the fast dynamics of the nematogen molecules within the domains using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo experiments. The problems of performing ultrafast IR experiments in pure liquids are discussed, and solutions are presented. In addition, the issue of short vibrational lifetimes, which limit the ability of 2D IR experiments to examine dynamics over a wide range of times, is addressed. The experiments were performed on the nematogen 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), with the CN stretch initially used as the vibrational probe. Although the CN stretch has a small transition dipole, because the sample is a pure liquid it is necessary to use an exceedingly thin sample to perform the experiments. The small sample volume leads to massive heating effects that distort the results. In addition, the high concentration in the pure liquid can result in vibrational excitation transfer that interferes with the measurements of structural dynamics, and the CN vibrational lifetime is very short (3.6 ps). These problems were overcome by performing the experiments on the natural-abundance (13)CN stretch (5(13)CB), which greatly reduced the absorbance, eliminating the heating problems; also, this stretch has a longer lifetime (7.9 ps). Experiments were also performed on benzonitrile, which showed that the heating problems associated with pure liquids are not unique to 5CB. Again, the problems were eliminated by conducting measurements on the (13)CN stretch, which has an even longer lifetime (20.2 ps) compared with the (12)CN stretch (5.6 ps). Finally, to extend the range of the dynamical measurements, 4-pentyl-4'-thiocyanobiphenyl (5SCB) was synthesized and studied as a dilute solute in 5CB. The CN stretch of 5SCB has a vibrational lifetime of 103 ps, which permits dynamical measurements to 200 ps, revealing the full range of fast structural dynamics in the isotropic phase of 5CB. It is shown that the 5SCB probe reports essentially the same dynamics as 5(13)CB on the short time scale that is observable with the 5(13)CB vibrational probe.},

abstract = {In the last ten years, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has become an important technique for studying molecular structures and dynamics. We report the implementation of heterodyne detected two-dimensional sum-frequency generation (HD 2D SFG) spectroscopy, which is the analog of 2D infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, but is selective to noncentrosymmetric systems such as interfaces. We implement the technique using mid-IR pulse shaping, which enables rapid scanning, phase cycling, and automatic phasing. Absorptive spectra are obtained, that have the highest frequency resolution possible, from which we extract the rephasing and nonrephasing signals that are sometimes preferred. Using this technique, we measure the vibrational mode of CO adsorbed on a polycrystalline Pt surface. The 2D spectrum reveals a significant inhomogenous contribution to the spectral line shape, which is quantified by simulations. This observation indicates that the surface conformation and environment of CO molecules is more complicated than the simple "atop" configuration assumed in previous work. Our method can be straightforwardly incorporated into many existing SFG spectrometers. The technique enables one to quantify inhomogeneity, vibrational couplings, spectral diffusion, chemical exchange, and many other properties analogous to 2D IR spectroscopy, but specifically for interfaces.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant of liquid water in the far-infrared region from 0.1 to 2.0 THz in a temperature range from 271.1 to 366.7 K. The data have been obtained with the use of THz time domain reflection spectroscopy, utilizing ultrashort electromagnetic pulses generated from a photoconductive antenna driven by femtosecond laser pulses. A Debye model with an additional relaxation time is used to fit the frequency dependence of the complex dielectric constants, We obtain a fast (fs) and a Debye (ps) relaxation time for the macroscopic polarization. The corresponding time correlation functions have been calculated with molecular dynamics simulations and are compared with experimental relaxation times. The temperature dependence of the Debye relaxation time is analyzed using three models: Transition state theory, a Debye-Stoke-Einstein relation between the viscosity and the Debye time, and a model stating that its temperature dependence can be extrapolated from a singularity of liquid water at 228 K. We find an excellent agreement between experiment and the two latter models. The simulations, however, present results with too large statistical error for establishing a relation for the temperature dependence. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The spectral position of C-D stretching absorptions in the so-called "transparent window" of protein absorption (1800-2300 cm(-1)) makes them well suited as probes of protein dynamics with high temporal and structural resolution. We have previously incorporated single deuterated amino acids into proteins to site-selectively follow protein folding and ligand binding by steady-state FT IR spectroscopy. Ultimately, our goal is to use C-D bonds as probes in time-resolved IR spectroscopy to study dynamics and intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in proteins. As a step toward this goal, we now present the first time-resolved experiments characterizing the population and dephasing dynamics of selectively excited C-D bonds in a deuterated amino acid. Three differently deuterated, Boc-protected leucines were selected to systematically alter the number of additional C-D bonds that may mediate IVR out of the initially populated bright C-D stretching mode. Three-pulse photon echo experiments show that the steady-state C-D absorption linewidths are broadened by both homogeneous and inhomogeneous effects, and transient grating experiments reveal that IVR occurs on a subpicosecond time scale and is nonstatistical. The results have important implications for the interpretation of steady-state C-D spectra and demonstrate the potential utility of C-D bonds as probes of dynamics and IVR within a protein.},

@article{Earle2006,
abstract = {It is widely believed that a defining characteristic of ionic liquids (or low-temperature molten salts) is that they exert no measurable vapour pressure, and hence cannot be distilled. Here we demonstrate that this is unfounded, and that many ionic liquids can be distilled at low pressure without decomposition. Ionic liquids represent matter solely composed of ions, and so are perceived as non-volatile substances. During the last decade, interest in the field of ionic liquids has burgeoned, producing a wealth of intellectual and technological challenges and opportunities for the production of new chemical and extractive processes, fuel cells and batteries, and new composite materials. Much of this potential is underpinned by their presumed involatility. This characteristic, however, can severely restrict the attainability of high purity levels for ionic liquids (when they contain poorly volatile components) in recycling schemes, as well as excluding their use in gas-phase processes. We anticipate that our demonstration that some selected families of commonly used aprotic ionic liquids can be distilled at 200-300 degrees C and low pressure, with concomitant recovery of significant amounts of pure substance, will permit these currently excluded applications to be realized.},

Cyclic voltammetric, chronoamperometric, together with microscopic and X-ray techniques reveal that micro/nanostructured Ag thin films of controlled morphology, size, density, and uniformity can be achieved by tuning the electrodeposition parameters such as potential, time, types of PILs, substrate materials, and ionic liquid viscosity by altering the water content. Chronoamperometric results provide direct evidence that electrodeposition of Ag in protic ionic liquids takes place through a progressive nucleation and diffusion-controlled 3D growth mechanism. The as prepared Ag micro/nanoparticles have been employed as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and exhibit excellent catalytic activity. The study provides promise for using protic ionic liquids as alternative electrolytes to conventional aprotic ionic liquids for electrodeposition of metals and nanostructured electrocatalysts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the structure and dynamics of the ionic liquid, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C(4)mim][Tf(2)N]) in the temperature range of 283-460 K. Extensive analysis was carried out to characterize a number of structural and dynamic features. Transport properties were computed using a variety of equilibrium methods that employed the Green-Kubo and Einstein formulations. Nonequilibrium techniques were also used. In general, different methods mostly yielded consistent results, although some differences were observed. Computed self-diffusivities and ionic conductivities tended to be slightly lower than experimental values, while computed viscosities were significantly higher than experiment. Computed thermal conductivities agreed reasonably well with experimental data. Despite these discrepancies, the simulations capture the experimental temperature-dependent trends for all these transport properties. Single ion dynamics were studied by examining diffusional anisotropy, the self-part of the van Hove function, non-Gaussian parameters, and incoherent intermediate scattering functions. It is found that cations diffuse faster than anions and are more dynamically heterogeneous. A clear anisotropy is revealed in cation displacement, with the motion normal to the imidazolium ring plane being the most hindered and the motion along the alkyl chain in the plane of the ring being the most facile. Cations structurally relax faster than anions but they rotationally relax slower than anions. There is a pronounced temperature dependence to the rotational anisotropy of the cations, but only a weak temperature dependence for the anions. The ionic conductivity deviates from the Nernst-Einstein relation due to the correlated motion of cations and anions. The results suggest that the dynamical behavior of this and related ionic liquids is extremely complex and consists of many different modes with widely varying timescales, making the prediction of dynamical trends extremely difficult.},

Under dry conditions, the permeabilities and selectivities of different gaseous penetrants were tested (CO<inf>2</inf>, CH<inf>4</inf>, N<inf>2</inf> and He), where both PIL membranes showed suitable features for CO<inf>2</inf>/CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> separation: a CO<inf>2</inf> permeability of 33Barrer at 35°C and selectivities up to 17 and 24 for CO<inf>2</inf>/CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf>/N<inf>2</inf> separation, respectively. Under humid conditions, the CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> permeabilities increased linearly with increasing water concentration within the PIL membranes.

Interestingly, water uptake was observed to be rather limited, never exceeding 2.5wt% for both PILs under the experimental conditions in this study.

abstract = {The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e.g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e.g. MnO(2), conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.},

The anisotropic spectra for these proteins all have a broad peak due to librational motion of side chains at 90 cm−1 and a background that may arise from bound water. The isotropic spectrum of lysozyme is similar to that of myoglobin, and has peaks at 240 and 500 cm−1 that are likely due to secondary structure fluctuations. These results suggest that low-frequency deformations of the protein molecule may contribute to the solvation dynamics of proteins in aqueous solution.},

We have employed three dimensional fluidic simulations to evaluate the mixing efficiency, and have constructed physical devices utilizing conventional microfabrication techniques. The simulation indicated thorough mixing at flow rate as low as 6 µL/s. The corresponding mean residence time is 0.44 ms for 90% of the particles simulated, or 0.49 ms for 95% of the particles simulated, respectively. The mixing efficiency of the physical device was also evaluated using fluorescein dye solutions and FluoSphere-red nanoparticles suspensions. The constructed micromixers achieved thorough mixing at the same flow rate of 6 µL/s, with the mixing indices of 96% ± 1%, and 98% ± 1% for the dye and the nanoparticle, respectively. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation data. The device demonstrated promising capabilities for time resolved studies for macromolecular dynamics of biological macromolecules.},

@article{Jomova2011,
abstract = {Detailed studies in the past two decades have shown that redox active metals like iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co) and other metals undergo redox cycling reactions and possess the ability to produce reactive radicals such as superoxide anion radical and nitric oxide in biological systems. Disruption of metal ion homeostasis may lead to oxidative stress, a state where increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms body antioxidant protection and subsequently induces DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein modification and other effects, all symptomatic for numerous diseases, involving cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), chronic inflammation and others. The underlying mechanism of action for all these metals involves formation of the superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical (mainly via Fenton reaction) and other ROS, finally producing mutagenic and carcinogenic malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and other exocyclic DNA adducts. On the other hand, the redox inactive metals, such as cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) show their toxic effects via bonding to sulphydryl groups of proteins and depletion of glutathione. Interestingly, for arsenic an alternative mechanism of action based on the formation of hydrogen peroxide under physiological conditions has been proposed. A special position among metals is occupied by the redox inert metal zinc (Zn). Zn is an essential component of numerous proteins involved in the defense against oxidative stress. It has been shown, that depletion of Zn may enhance DNA damage via impairments of DNA repair mechanisms. In addition, Zn has an impact on the immune system and possesses neuroprotective properties. The mechanism of metal-induced formation of free radicals is tightly influenced by the action of cellular antioxidants. Many low-molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), glutathione (GSH), carotenoids, flavonoids, and other antioxidants) are capable of chelating metal ions reducing thus their catalytic acitivity to form ROS. A novel therapeutic approach to supress oxidative stress is based on the development of dual function antioxidants comprising not only chelating, but also scavenging components. Parodoxically, two major antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase contain as an integral part of their active sites metal ions to battle against toxic effects of metal-induced free radicals. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of redox and non-redox metal-induced formation of free radicals and the role of oxidative stress in toxic action of metals. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency is accompanied by various down-stream, adaptive responses which play a key role in the varied phenotypes observed when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. These responses are often accompanied by the induction of genes involved in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. Among these responses, metallothioneins (MTs) has been identified to be responsive to mitochondrial dysfunction. MTs, which are expressed in four different isoforms, are small, cysteine rich, metal binding proteins that have been associated with a protective effect in cells under numerous diseased and stressed states. Their diverse functionality and protective roles can be ascribed to their three basic abilities or primary functions which are metal homeostasis, heavy metal detoxification and free radical scavenging. The involvement of MTs with numerous cellular processes, organelles and cells has received much attention while notice of their involvement with the function of mitochondria has been lacking. It is believed that MTs promote the survival of mitochondrial dysfunctional cells by acting as highly efficient reducing elements against the damaging properties of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by limiting apoptosis. In addition to their role in mitochondrial disease, convincing evidence exist, albeit with conflicting results, of its involvement in some key functions of the mitochondrion, including redox modulation, metal homeostasis and enzyme and transcription factor regulation.},

abstract = {Ice formation next to solid surfaces is important in many biological, materials, and geological phenomena and may be a factor in how they impact various technologies. We have used sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to study the structure of ice as well as the freezing and melting transition temperatures of water in contact with sapphire substrates. We have observed that the structure of ice and water are a function of pH and the surface charge of the sapphire substrate. At low pH, we observed an increase in the SFG signal subsequent to ice formation. Contrary to expectations, at pH 9.8, corresponding to a negatively charged surface, the intensity of the ice SFG signal is about 10 times lower than that of water. Recent simulation studies have suggested that charge transfer is important for the high intensity of the ice peak at the ice-air interface. We believe that the segregation of sodium ions next to the negatively charged sapphire substrate may be responsible for disrupting the charge transfer and stitching bilayer at high pH, providing a plausible explanation for the experimental observations. Even though the structure of water and ice are affected by pH, the freezing and melting transition temperatures are independent of the surface charge. This report offers a unique insight on how ions next to solid surfaces could influence the structure of ice.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared photon-echo measurements of the OH stretching vibration in liquid H2O are performed at various temperatures. Spectral diffusion and resonant energy transfer occur on a time scale much shorter than the average hydrogen bond lifetime of {approx}1 ps. Room temperature measurements show a loss of frequency and, thus, structural correlations on a 50-fs time scale. Weakly hydrogen-bonded OH stretching oscillators absorbing at high frequencies undergo slower spectral diffusion than strongly bonded oscillators. In the temperature range from 340 to 274 K, the loss in memory slows down with decreasing temperature. At 274 K, frequency correlations in the OH stretch vibration persist beyond {approx}200 fs, pointing to a reduction in dephasing by librational excitations. Polarization-resolved pump-probe studies give a resonant intermolecular energy transfer time of 80 fs, which is unaffected by temperature. At low temperature, structural correlations persist longer than the energy transfer time, suggesting a delocalization of OH stretching excitations over several water molecules.},

abstract = {The native state of a globular protein is essential for its biocatalytic function, but is marginally stable against unfolding. While unfolding equilibria are often reversible, folding intermediates and misfolds can promote irreversible protein aggregation into amorphous precipitates or highly ordered amyloid states. Addition of ionic liquids-low-melting organic salts-offers intriguing prospects for stabilizing native proteins and their enzymatic function against these deactivating reaction channels. The huge number of cations and anions that form ionic liquids allows fine-tuning of their solvent properties, which offers robust and efficient strategies for solvent optimization. Going beyond case-by-case studies, this article aims at discussing principles for a rational design of ionic liquid-based formulations in protein chemistry and biocatalysis.},

abstract = {Water possesses an extremely high polarity, making it a unique solvent for salts. Indeed, aqueous electrolyte solutions are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, biology, energy applications and industrial processes. For many processes, chemical reactions at the water surface are rate determining, and the nature and concentration of the surface-bound electrolytes are of paramount importance, as they determine the water structure and thereby surface reactivity. Here we investigate the dynamics of water molecules at the surface of sodium chloride and sodium iodide solutions, using surface-specific femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy. We quantify the interfacial ion density through the reduced energy transfer rates between water molecules resulting from the lowered effective interfacial density of water molecules, as water is displaced by surface active ions. Our results reveal remarkably high surface propensities for halogenic anions, higher for iodide than for chloride ions, corresponding to surface ion concentrations several times that of the bulk.},

abstract = {We have implemented the combined quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of alanine dipeptide in water along with the polarizable and nonpolarizable classical MD simulations with different models of water. For the QM/MM MD simulation, the alanine dipeptide is treated with the AM1 or PM3 approximations and the fluctuating solute dipole moment is calculated by the Mulliken population analysis. For the classical MD simulations, the solute is treated with the polarizable or nonpolarizable AMBER and polarizable CHARMM force fields and water is treated with the TIP3P, TIP4P, or TIP5P model. It is found that the relative populations of right-handed $\alpha$ -helix and extended Β and PII conformations in the simulation trajectory strongly depend on the simulation method. For the QM/MM MD simulations, the PM3/MM shows that the PII conformation is dominant, whereas the AM1/MM predicts that the dominant conformation is $\alpha$R. Polarizable CHARMM force field gives almost exclusively PII conformation and other force fields predict that both $\alpha$ -helical and extended (Β and PII) conformations are populated with varying extents. Solvation environment around the dipeptide is investigated by examining the radial distribution functions and numbers and lifetimes of hydrogen bonds. Comparing the simulated IR and vibrational circular dichroism spectra with experimental results, we concluded that the dipeptide adopts the PII conformation and PM3/MM, AMBER03 with TIP4P water, and AMBER polarizable force fields are acceptable for structure determination of the dipeptide considered in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Four methods for acquiring HDVE phase and amplitude spectra were compared: Fourier transform spectral interferometry, a new phase modulation spectral interferometry technique, and combination schemes. These extraction techniques were demonstrated in the context of protein amide I spectroscopy. Experimental HDVE and heterodyned free induction decay amide I spectra were explicitly compared to conventional dispersed pump−probe, dispersed vibrational echo, and absorption spectra. The new capabilities of HDVE were demonstrated by acquiring single-shot spectra and melting curves of ubiquitin and concentration-dependent spectra of insulin suitable for extracting the binding constant for dimerization. The introduced techniques will prove particularly useful in transient experiments, studying irreversible reactions, and micromolar concentration studies of small proteins.},

abstract = {Potassium (K+) channels are specialized membrane proteins that are able to facilitate and regulate the conduction of K+ through cell membranes. Comprising five specific cation binding sites (S-0-S-4) formed by the backbone carbonyl groups of conserved residues common to all K+ channels, the narrow selectivity filter allows fast conduction of K+ while being highly selective for K+ over Na+. To extend our knowledge of the microscopic mechanism underlying selectivity in K+ channels, we characterize the free energy landscapes governing the entry and translocation of a Na+ or a K+ from the extracellular side into the selectivity filter of KcsA. The entry process of an extracellular ion is examined in the presence of two additional K+ in the pore, and the three-ion potential of mean force is computed using extensive all-atom umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the potentials of mean force yields a number of important results. First, the free energy minima corresponding to configurations with extracellular K+ or Na+ in binding site So or Si are similar in depth, suggesting that the thermodynamic selectivity governed by the free energy minima for those two binding sites is insignificant. Second, the free energy barriers between stable multi-ion configurations are generally higher for Na+ than for K+, implying that the kinetics of ion conduction is slower when a Na+ enters the pore. Third, the region corresponding to binding site S-2 near the center of the narrow pore emerges as the most selective for K+ over Na+. In particular, while there is a stable minimum for K+ in site S-2, Na+ faces a steep free energy increase with no local free energy well in this region. Lastly, analysis shows that selectivity is not correlated with the overall coordination number of the ion entering the pore, but is predominantly affected by changes in the type of coordinating ligands (carbonyls versus water molecules). These results further highlight the importance of the central region near binding site S-2 in the selectivity filter of K+ channels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {K+ channels conduct and regulate K+ flux across the cell membrane. Several crystal structures and biophysical studies of tetrameric ion channels have revealed many of the structural details of ion selectivity and gating. A narrow pore lined with four arrays of carbonyl groups is responsible for ion selectivity, whereas a conformational change of the four inner transmembrane helices (TM2) is involved in gating. We used NMR to examine full-length KcsA, a prototypical K+ channel, in its open, closed and intermediate states. These studies reveal that at least two conformational states exist both in the selectivity filter and near the C-terminal ends of the TM2 helices. In the ion-conducting open state, we observed rapid structural exchange between two conformations of the filter, presumably of low and high K+ affinity, respectively. Such measurements of millisecond-timescale dynamics reveal the basis for simultaneous ion selection and gating.},

abstract = {A new pH and metal ion-responsive BODIPY-based fluorescent probe with an aza crown ether subunit has been synthesized via condensation of 4-(1,4,7,10-tetraoxa-13-aza-cyclopentadec-13-yl)-benzaldehyde with the appropriate 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl substituted boron dipyrromethene moiety. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorometries have been used to study the spectroscopic and photophysical characteristics of this probe in various solvents. The fluorescence properties of the dye are strongly solvent dependent: increasing the solvent polarity leads to lower fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes, and the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission shifts to the red. The Catalan solvent scales are found to be the most suitable for describing the solvatochromic shifts of the fluorescence emission. Fluorescence decay profiles of the dye can be described by a single-exponential fit in nonprotic solvents, whereas two decay times are found in alcohols. Protonation as well as complex formation with several metal ions are investigated in acetonitrile as solvent via fluorometric titrations. The aza crown ether dye undergoes a reversible (de)protonation reaction (pKa = 0.09) and shows a approximately 50 nm blue shift in the excitation spectra and a 10-fold fluorescence increase upon protonation. The compound also forms 1:1 complexes with several metal ions (Li(+), Na(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Ba(2+), Zn(2+)), producing large blue shifts in the excitation spectra and significant cation-induced fluorescence amplifications.},

Using a combination of protein semisynthesis, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we probe the ion occupancy at the S1 binding site in the constricted state of the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel when the intracellular gate is open and closed. The 2D IR spectra resolve two features, whose relative intensities depend on the state of the intracellular gate. By matching the experiment to calculated 2D IR spectra of structures predicted by MD simulations, we identify the two features as corresponding to states with S1 occupied or unoccupied by K+. We learn that S1 is >70% occupied when the intracellular gate is closed and <15% occupied when the gate is open. Comparison of MD trajectories show that opening of the intracellular gate causes a structural change in the selectivity filter, which leads to a change in the io},

abstract = {In this paper we report on the transport properties of protic and aprotic ionic liquids of the imidazolium cation (C2C1Im(+) or C2HIm(+)) and the TFSI(-) or TfO(-) anion as a function of added water. We observe that the self-diffusion coefficient of the ionic species increases upon addition of water, and that the cation diffuses faster than the anion in the entire water concentration range investigated. We also observe that the overall increase of anionic and cationic diffusion coefficients is significant for C2HImTfO while it is rather weak for C2C1ImTFSI, the former being more hydrophilic. Moreover, the difference between cationic and anionic self-diffusivity specifically depends on the structure of the ionic liquid's ions. The degree of ion-ion association has been investigated by comparing the molar conductivity obtained by impedance measurements with the molar conductivity calculated from NMR data using the Nernst-Einstein equation. Our data indicate that the ions are partly dissociated ($\Lambda$imp/$\Lambda$NMR in the range 0.45-0.75) but also that the degree of association decreases in the order C2HImTfO > C2HImTFSI ≈ C2C1ImTfO > C2C1ImTFSI. From these results, it seems that water finds different sites of interaction in the protic and aprotic ionic liquids, with a strong preference for hydrogen bonding to the -NH group (when available) and a stronger affinity to the TfO anion as compared to the TFSI. For the protic ionic liquids, the analysis of (1)H NMR chemical shifts (upon addition of H2O and D2O, respectively) indicates a water-cation interaction of hydrogen bonding nature. In addition, we could probe proton exchange between the -NH group and deuterated water for the protic cation, which occurs at a significantly faster rate if associated with the TfO anion as compared to the TFSI.},

As the temperature decreases, the (18)O-induced (13)C chemical-shift separations increase not only at carboxyl carbons but also at ipso (alkene) carbons. The magnitude of the ipso increase is consistent with an (18)O isotope effect on carboxylic acid acidity. Therefore it is concluded that this monoanion is a mixture of tautomers in rapid equilibrium, rather than a single symmetric structure in which a chemical-shift separation arises from coupling between a desymmetrizing vibration and anharmonic isotope-dependent vibrations, which is expected to show the opposite temperature dependence.},

It is thought that the combinatorial association between distinct alpha and beta subunits determines whether Kv channels function as non-inactivating delayed rectifiers or as rapidly inactivating A-type channels. We show that membrane lipids can convert A-type channels into delayed rectifiers and vice versa. Phosphoinositides remove N-type inactivation from A-type channels by immobilizing the inactivation domains. Conversely, arachidonic acid and its amide anandamide endow delayed rectifiers with rapid voltage-dependent inactivation. The bidirectional control of Kv channel gating by lipids may provide a mechanism for the dynamic regulation of electrical signaling in the nervous system.},

abstract = {The vibrational dynamics of the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of very low concentration spatially isolated D(2)O molecules in the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BmImPF(6)) were examined using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy and infrared pump-probe experiments. In BmImPF(6), D(2)O's antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes are well resolved in the IR absorption spectrum in spite of the fact that the D(2)O is surrounded by a sea of ions, making it is possible to study inter- and intramolecular dynamics. Both population exchange between the modes and excited-state relaxation to the ground state contribute to the population dynamics. The kinetics for the incoherent population exchange (scattering) between the two modes was determined by the time dependence of the exchange peaks in the 2D IR spectrum. In addition, coherent quantum beats were observed at short time in both the amplitudes and 2D IR band shapes of the modes. The quantum beat decay is caused by dephasing due to both inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening of the spectral lines. Analysis of the oscillations of the 2D line shapes demonstrates that there is some degree of anticorrelation in the inhomogeneous broadening of the two modes. It is proposed that a distribution in the coupling strength between the local modes that give rise to symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates is responsible for the anticorrelation. Spectral diffusion, caused by structural evolution of the medium, occurs on multiple time scales and is identical for the two modes within experimental error. The spectral diffusion is fast compared to the time scale for complete orientational randomization of the RTIL. Spectral diffusion of the OD stretch of HOD in BmImPF(6) was also measured, and is essentially the same as that of the D(2)O modes. Orientational anisotropy measurements of HOD in BmImPF(6) determined the orientational relaxation dynamics of the isolated HOD molecules.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate OH reorientation in the four isomeric butanols in their bulk liquid state to examine the influence of the arrangement of the steric bulk on the alcohol reorientational and hydrogen-bond (H-bond) dynamics. The results are interpreted within the extended jump model in which the OH reorientation is decomposed into contributions due to "jumps" between H-bond partners and "frame" reorientation of the intact H-bonded pair. Reorientation is fastest in iso-butanol and slowest in tert-butanol, while sec- and n-butanol have similar reorientation times. This latter result is a fortuitous cancellation between the jump and frame reorientation in the two alcohols. The extended jump model is shown to provide a quantitative description of the OH reorientation times. A detailed analysis of the jump times shows that a combination of entropic, enthalpic, and dynamical factors, including transition state recrossing effects, all play a role. A simple model based on the liquid structure is proposed to estimate the energetic and entropic contributions to the jump time. This represents the groundwork for a predictive model of OH reorientation in alcohols, but additional studies are required to better understand the frame reorientation and transition state recrossing effects.},

abstract = {1,3-Disubstituted imidazolium ionic liquids have been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies due to their low viscosity-often the very lowest for any given cation/anion family. One of the mysteries in the imidazolium family of salts is the sharp increase in viscosity that is observed on methylating at the C2 position in the ring. In the nonmethylated case, the C2 proton is observed to be distinctly acidic and, where this is undesirable, substitution of the C2 position removes the problem, but produces an unexpected increase in viscosity. Methylation at other positions on the ring does not produce such a significant effect. In this study, two possible structural or energetic sources of the increased viscosity were investigated: (1) ion association, as probed by the Walden rule, and (2) differences in the potential energy surface profiles that favor ionic transport in the non C2-methylated imidazolium ionic liquids. The second hypothesis was investigated using high-level ab initio theory. The higher viscosity of C2-methylated imidazolium ionic liquids is shown to be a result of high potential energy barriers (significantly above the available thermal energy) between the energetically preferred conformations on the potential energy surface, thus restricting movement of ions in the liquid state to only small oscillations and inhibiting the overall ion transport.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress has been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Oxygen is vital for life but is also potentially dangerous, and a complex system of checks and balances exists for utilizing this essential element. Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance in pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis that leads to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The systems in place to cope with the biochemistry of oxygen are complex, and many questions about the mechanisms of oxygen regulation remain unanswered. However, this same complexity provides a number of therapeutic targets, and different strategies, including novel metal-protein attenuating compounds, aimed at a variety of targets have shown promise in clinical studies.},

In this Account, we consider recent developments in the areas of protein and nucleic acid solvation and hydration as seen by experiment, theory, and simulations. We find that in most cases not only the general phenomena of solvation but even local hydration patterns are more accurately discussed in the context of water distributions rather than individual molecules of water. While a few localized or high-residency waters are often associated with macromolecules in solution (or crystals from aqueous liquors), these are readily and accurately included in this more general description. The goal of this Account is to review the theoretical models used for the description of the interfacial solvent structure on the border near DNA and protein molecules. In particular, we hope to highlight the progress in this field over the past five years with a focus on comparison of simulation and experimental results.},

abstract = {Abstract Low-temperature (200?K) protonation of [Mo(CO)(Cp*)H(PMe3)2] (1) by Et2O?HBF4 gives a different result depending on a subtle solvent change: The dihydrogen complex [Mo(CO)(Cp*)(?2-H2)(PMe3)2]+ (2) is obtained in THF, whereas the tautomeric classical dihydride [Mo(CO)(Cp*)(H)2(PMe3)2]+ (3) is the only observable product in dichloromethane. Both products were fully characterised (?CO IR; 1H, 31P, 13C?NMR spectroscopies) at low temperature; they lose H2 upon warming to 230?K at approximately the same rate (ca. 10?3?s?1), with no detection of the non-classical form in CD2Cl2, to generate [Mo(CO)(Cp*)(FBF3)(PMe3)2] (4). The latter also slowly decomposes at ambient temperature. One of the decomposition products was crystallised and identified by X-ray crystallography as [Mo(CO)(Cp*)(FH???FBF3)(PMe3)2] (5), which features a neutral HF ligand coordinated to the transition metal through the F atom and to the BF4? anion through a hydrogen bond. The reason for the switch in relative stability between 2 and 3 was probed by DFT calculations based on the B3LYP and M05-2X functionals, with inclusion of anion and solvent effects by the conductor-like polarisable continuum model and by explicit consideration of the solvent molecules. Calculations at the MP4(SDQ) and CCSD(T) levels were also carried out for calibration. The calculations reveal the key role of non-covalent anion?solvent interactions, which modulate the anion?cation interaction ultimately altering the energetic balance between the two isomeric forms.},

@article{sharpACR-10,
abstract = {Water is a highly polar molecule, consisting of a very electronegative atom, oxygen, bonded to two weakly electropositive hydrogen atoms with two lone pairs of electrons. These features give water remarkable physical properties, some of which are anomalous, such as its lower density in the solid phase compared with the liquid phase. Its ability to serve as both a hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor governs its role as a solvent, a role that is of central interest for biological chemists. In this Account, we focus on water's properties as a Solvent. Water dissolves a vast range of solutes with solubilities that range over 10 orders of magnitude. Differences in solubility define the fundamental dichotomy between polar, or hydrophilic, solutes and apolar, or hydrophobic, solutes. This important distinction plays a large part in the structure, stability, and function of biological macromolecules. The strength of hydrogen bonding depends on the H-O center dot center dot center dot O H-bond angle, and the angular distribution is bimodal. Changes in the width and frequency of infrared spectral lines and in the heat capacity of the solution provide a measure of the changes in the strength and distribution of angles of the hydrogen bonds. Polar solutes and inorganic ions increase the population of bent hydrogen bonds at the expense of the more linear population, while apolar solutes or groups have the opposite effect.

We examine how protein denaturants might alter the solvation behavior of water. Urea has very little effect on water's hydrogen bond network, while guanidinium ions promote more linear hydrogen bonds. These results point to fundamental differences in the protein denaturation mechanisms of these molecules. We also suggest a mechanism of action for antifreeze (or thermal hysteresis) proteins: ordering of water around the surface of these proteins prior to freezing appears to interfere with ice formation.},

Study Design The records of an Australian-based pathology laboratory were searched for oral mucosal biopsies with a dysplastic or malignant diagnosis. Examination for an association with progression and malignant transformation without reinterpretation was performed. Analysis was undertaken using hazard ratios and the Fisher exact test. Results A total of 368 patients with a diagnosis of OED were included. Twenty-six patients (7.1%) underwent progression or malignant transformation; the annual malignant transformation rate was 1%. No other characteristics were associated with a heightened risk of progression or transformation. Conclusions The severity of OED was not associated with risk of malignant transformation, suggesting that the current OED grading system is not useful for predicting patient outcomes or for determining management strategies. Definitive treatment of all OED is recommended, until a more reliable progression/transformation system is developed.},

abstract = {The infrared spectra of six aqueous carboxylate anions have been calculated at the M05-2X/cc-pVTZ level of theory with the SMD solvent model, and validated against experimental data from the literature over the region of 1700 cm -1 to 1250 cm-1; this region corresponds to the stretching modes of the carboxylate group, and is often interrogated when probing bonding of carboxylates to other species and surfaces. The anions studied here were formate, acetate, oxalate, succinate, glutarate and citrate. For the lowest energy conformer of each anion, the carboxylate moiety antisymmetric stretching peak was predicted with a mean signed error of only 4 cm-1 using the SMD solvent model, while the symmetric peak was slightly overestimated. Performing calculations in vacuum and scaling was found to generally over-predict the antisymmetric vibrational frequencies and under predict the symmetric peak. Different conformers of the same anion were found to have only slightly different spectra in the studied region and the inclusion of explicit water molecules was not found to significantly change the calculated spectra when the implicit solvent model is used. Overall, the use of density functional theory in conjunction with an implicit solvent model was found to result in infra-red spectra that are the best reproduction of the features found experimentally for the aqueous carboxylate ions in the important 1700 cm -1 to 1250 cm-1 region. The development of validated model chemistries for simulating the stretching modes of aqueous carboxylate ions will be valuable for future studies that investigate how carboxylate anions complex with multivalent metal cations and related species in solution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the water dipole flips when an electric field is applied in the opposite direction of the electric field generated from the surface charge of a solid insulator (calcium fluoride). The required electric field is extremely low compared to that expected by the zeta potential, implying that the structure of the SFG signal is formed not on the calcium fluoride surface, where the electric field is expected to be the strongest, but further from the interface.},

While the structure of bestrophin revealed it is an anion-permeable pore, only indirect evidence exists that TMEM16 and LRRC8 form anion channels. This review summarizes the most recent information on the structure, function, and physiological relevance of these anion channel proteins, and highlights their overlapping functions and physiological roles.},

abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of femtosecond Fourier transform two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to protein secondary structure with a study of antiparallel beta-sheets. The results show that 2D IR spectroscopy is more sensitive to structural differences between proteins than traditional infrared spectroscopy, providing an observable that allows comparison to quantitative models of protein vibrational spectroscopy. 2D IR correlation spectra of the amide I region of poly-l-lysine, concanavalin A, ribonuclease A, and lysozyme show cross-peaks between the IR-active transitions that are characteristic of amide I couplings for polypeptides in antiparallel hydrogen-bonding registry. For poly-l-lysine, the 2D IR spectrum contains the eight-peak structure expected for two dominant vibrations of an extended, ordered antiparallel beta-sheet. In the proteins with antiparallel beta-sheets, interference effects between the diagonal and cross-peaks arising from the sheets, combined with diagonally elongated resonances from additional amide transitions, lead to a characteristic "Z"-shaped pattern for the amide I region in the 2D IR spectrum. We discuss in detail how the number of strands in the sheet, the local configurational disorder in the sheet, the delocalization of the vibrational excitation, and the angle between transition dipole moments affect the position, splitting, amplitude, and line shape of the cross-peaks and diagonal peaks.},

abstract = {Because of its sensitivity to chemical and electrostatic characteristics, nitrile group as an infrared (IR) probe to monitor the local structure, folding kinetics, and electrostatic environment of protein, or solvation of molecular solvents, has attracted increasing attention. Herein, by choosing benzonitrile and imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) as the IR probe and model ILs, respectively, we report that the nitrile stretching vibration ($\nu$CN) could be utilized as a simple and substantial IR probe to monitor the local environment of ILs such as hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) as well as intrinsic electric field. In 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based non-hydroxyl ILs, the $\nu$CN is in a "free" state, and is less affected by the alkyl chain, while it significantly decreases with the effective anion charge. In 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium-based hydroxyl ILs, however, a distinct anion-dependent $\nu$CN forming H-bonding with the hydroxyl is also observed besides the "free" $\nu$CN band. The "free" component of $\nu$CN can be further employed to determine the intrinsic electric field in both non-hydroxyl (directly) and hydroxyl (indirectly by subtracting H-bonding contribution) ILs by using vibrational Stark effect. Moreover, the result suggests that benzonitrile is preferentially located in the charge domain in ILs and it could be a more suitable probe to report the ionic network rather than the nonpolar domain in ILs.},

Femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy is used to inject an electron into an ultrathin film of RTIL 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmpyr](+)[NTf2](-)). While much of current literature highlights slower nanosecond solvation mechanisms in bulk ionic liquids, we observe only a femtosecond response, supporting morphology dependent and interface specific electron solvation mechanisms. The injected excess electron is found to reside in an electron affinity level residing near the metal surface. Population of this state decays back to the metal with a time constant of 400 ± 150 fs. Electron solvation is measured as a dynamic decrease in the energy with a time constant of 350 ± 150 fs. We observe two distinct temperature regimes, with a critical temperature near 250 K. The low temperature regime is characterized by a higher work function of 4.41 eV, while the high temperature regime is characterized by a lower work function of 4.19 eV. The total reorganizational energy of solvation changes above and below the critical temperature. In the high temperature regime, the electron affinity level solvates by 540 meV at 350 K, and below the critical temperature, solvation decreases to 200 meV at 130 K. This study will provide valuable insight to interface specific solvation of room temperature ionic liquids.},

abstract = {{Examples of coupled irreversible processes like the thermoelectric phenomena, the transference phenomena in electrolytes and heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are considered. For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e,g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m.f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that: his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. ()$1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics ($3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. ($4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. ($5.} The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasithermodynamic theories is discussed. ($6.) The principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present, and the reciprocal relations break down. ($7.)},

abstract = {Long-lived excitonic coherence in photosynthetic proteins has become an exciting area of research because it may provide design principles for enhancing the efficiency of energy transfer in a broad range of materials. In this publication, we provide new evidence that long-lived excitonic coherence in the Fenna-Mathew-Olson pigment-protein (FMO) complex is consistent with the assumption of cross correlation in the site basis, indicating that each site shares bath fluctuations. We analyze the structure and character of the beating crosspeak between the two lowest energy excitons in two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra of the FMO Complex. To isolate this dynamic signature, we use the two-dimensional linear prediction Z-transform as a platform for filtering coherent beating signatures within 2D spectra. By separating signals into components in frequency and decay rate representations, we are able to improve resolution and isolate specific coherences. This strategy permits analysis of the shape, position, character, and phase of these features. Simulations of the crosspeak between excitons 1 and 2 in FMO under different regimes of cross correlation verify that statistically independent site fluctuations do not account for the elongation and persistence of the dynamic crosspeak. To reproduce the experimental results, we invoke near complete correlation in the fluctuations experienced by the sites associated with excitons 1 and 2. This model contradicts ab initio quantum mechanic∕molecular mechanics simulations that observe no correlation between the energies of individual sites. This contradiction suggests that a new physical model for long-lived coherence may be necessary. The data presented here details experimental results that must be reproduced for a physical model of quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer.},

They have a unique three-domain structure, comprising a calcium-regulated N-terminal domain with eight EF-hands, a mitochondrial carrier domain, and a C-terminal domain. Here we present the calcium-bound and calcium-free structures of the N- and C-terminal domains, elucidating the mechanism of calcium regulation. Unexpectedly, EF-hands 4-8 are involved in dimerization of the carrier and form a static unit, whereas EF-hands 1-3 form a calcium-responsive mobile unit. On calcium binding, an amphipathic helix of the C-terminal domain binds to the N-terminal domain, opening a vestibule. In the absence of calcium, the mobile unit closes the vestibule. Opening and closing of the vestibule might regulate access of substrates to the carrier domain, which is involved in their transport. These structures provide a framework for understanding cases of the mitochondrial disease citrin deficiency.},

The obtained chi(2) spectra clearly showed flip-flop of the interfacial water molecules which is induced by the opposite charge of the head group of the surfactants. With the sign of beta(2) theoretically obtained, the absolute orientation, i.e., up/down orientation, of water molecules at the charged aqueous surfaces was uniquely determined by the relation between the sign of chi(2) and the molecular orientation angle.

In this study, we measure the frequency-frequency time correlation function for the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the azido group of azido-NAD(+) in water. Our results are consistent with previous studies of pseudohalides in water. We conclude that azido-NAD(+) is sensitive to local environmental fluctuations, which, in water, are dominated by hydrogen-bond dynamics of the water molecules around the probe. Our results demonstrate the potential of azido-NAD(+) as a vibrational probe and illustrate the potential of substituted NAD(+)-analogs as reporters of local structural dynamics that could be used for studies of protein dynamics in NAD-dependent enzymes.},

The reaction is caused by an interaction between the anion and cation that allows proton transfer, and involves a phosphonium ylide intermediate. The cation reaction can be mitigated by using ammonium rather than phosphonium cations. Thus, phosphonium and ammonium cations paired with aprotic heterocyclic anions (AHAs) react with CO2 through different mechanisms at elevated temperatures. This work shows that careful consideration of both physical properties and chemical reactivity of ILs based on AHA anions is needed when designing ionic liquids for CO2 separations.},

We determined the structural rearrangements associated with MscS activation in membranes, using functorial measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and computational analyses. MscS was trapped in its open conformation after the transbilayer pressure profile was modified through the asymmetric incorporation of lysophospholipids. The transition from the closed to the open state is accompanied by the downward tilting of the transmembrane TM1-TM2 hairpin and by the expansion, tilt, and rotation of the TM3 helices. These movements expand the permeation pathway, leading to an increase in accessibility to water around TM3. Our open MscS model is compatible with single-channel conductance measurements and supports the notion that helix tilting is associated with efficient pore widening in mechanosensitive channels.

abstract = {Treatment of human cells with Type 1 interferons restricts HIV replication. Here we report that the tripartite motif protein TRIM22 is a key mediator. We used transcriptional profiling to identify cellular genes that were induced by interferon treatment and identified TRIM22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes. We confirmed, as in previous studies, that TRIM22 over-expression inhibited HIV replication. To assess the role of TRIM22 expressed under natural inducing conditions, we compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted for TRIM22 using RNAi and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the knockdown, implying that TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TRIM22 inhibited budding of virus-like particles containing Gag only, indicating that Gag was the target of TRIM22. TRIM22 did not block the release of MLV or EIAV Gag particles. Inhibition was associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of HIV Gag rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane, suggesting TRIM22 disrupts proper trafficking. Mutational analyses of TRIM22 showed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain are required for TRIM22 antiviral activity. These data disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication. },

abstract = {The ability to mix aqueous liquids on microsecond time scales, while consuming minimal amounts of sample and maintaining UV-visible optical access to the mixing region, is highly desirable for a range of biophysical studies of fast protein and nucleic acid interactions and folding. We have constructed a laminar coaxial jet mixer that allows the measurement of UV-excited fluorescence from nanoliter and microliter quantities of material, mixed at microsecond rates. The mixer injects a narrow cylindrical stream (radius a < 1 microm) of fluorescent sample into a larger flow of diluting buffer that moves through a capillary (100 microm i.d.) at a speed approximately 20 cm/s, under laminar flow conditions (Re approximately equal to 14). Construction from a fused silica capillary allows the laser excitation (at 266 nm) and detection (at 350 nm) of tryptophan fluorescence at reasonably low working concentrations, without interference from background fluorescence. Using this mixer we have measured sub-millisecond fluorescence quenching kinetics while consuming fluorescent sample at rates no greater than 6 nl/s. Consumption of the diluting buffer is also very modest (approximately 1-3 microl/s) in comparison with other rapid mixer designs.},

abstract = {Molecules or ions which are amphiphilic, i.e. contain at the same time a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic (normally an alkyl chain) part frequently display in aqueous solutions a characteristic strongly cooperative association into colloidal aggregates termed micelles. A general treatment of micellization and related phenomena is given in order to provide an understanding on a molecular level. Hydrophobic interactions are the driving force in micellization but the inclusion of hydrophilic group interactions is required in the thermodynamic description. Intra- and intermicellar electrostatic repulsions are discussed in connection with the changes in micelle shape occuring at higher concentrations or at addition of electrolyte etc. The kinetics of micelle formation is characterized by two greatly different time constants, the rapid one referring to the micelle-monomer exchange and the other to the dissolution and formation of micelles. A large number of physico-chemical methods applicable to the study of micelle formation are surveyed with special emphasis on recent spectroscopic approaches which give a detailed insight into structure, dynamics and interactions. For example, the hydrocarbon chains are characterized by a rapid but slightly hindered motion. The polar head-groups are hydrated while otherwise no appreciable water-amphiphile contact occurs in the micelles. The binding of small counter-ions to micelles of ionic amphiphiles is characterized by a marked specificity affecting both spectroscopic and macroscopic properties. The phenomena of solubilization, mixed micelle formation and micellar catalysis are discussion on a molecular basis as well as the formation of reversed micelles and amphiphile aggregation in non-aqueous media. The biological implications of micelle formation are briefly indicated.},

abstract = {In this paper different floating oscillator models for describing the amide I band of peptides and proteins are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Models for the variation of the frequency shifts of the oscillators and the nearest-neighbor coupling between them with respect to conformation are constructed from DFT normal mode calculations on N-acetyl-glycine-N-'-methylamide. The calculated frequencies are compared with those obtained from existing electrostatic models. Furthermore, a new transition charge coupling model is presented. We suggest a model which combines the nearest-neighbor maps with long-range interactions accounted for using the new transition charge model and an existing electrostatic map for long-range interaction frequency shifts. This model and others, which account for the frequency shifts by electrostatic maps exclusively, are tested by comparing the predicted IR spectra with those from DFT calculations on the pentapeptide [Leu]-enkephalin. The new model described above gives the best agreement and, after a systematic blueshift is accounted for, reproduces the DFT frequencies to within 3.5 cm(-1). The correlation of the intensities for this model with intensities from DFT calculations is 0.94. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

Systematic investigations of various factors affecting the stability of membrane proteins, as well as their potential to crystallize three dimensionally, have paved the way for such achievements. The importance of the role of detergents both at the level of purification and crystallization is now well established. In addition, the recognition of the protein-detergent complex as the entity to crystallize, as well as the understanding of its physical-chemical properties and discovery of factors affecting these, have permitted the design of better crystallization strategies. As a consequence of the various efforts in the field, new crystallization methods for membrane proteins are being implemented. These have already been successful and are expected to contribute significantly to the future successes. This chapter will review some basic principles in membrane protein crystallization and give an overview of the current state of the art in the field. Some practical guidelines to help the novice approach the problem of membrane protein crystallization from the initial step of protein purification to crystallogenesis will also be given.},

abstract = {Protein dynamics and interactions in myoglobin (Mb) were characterized via two vibrational dynamics labels (VDLs): a genetically incorporated site-specific azide (Az) bearing unnatural amino acid (AzPhe43) and an active site CO ligand. The Az-labeled protein was studied using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy. CO bound at the active site of the heme serves as a second VDL located nearby. Therefore, it was possible to use Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and 2D IR spectroscopic experiments on the Az in unligated Mb and in Mb bound to CO (MbAzCO) and on the CO in MbCO and MbAzCO to investigate the environment and motions of different states of one protein from the perspective of two spectrally resolved VDLs. A very broad bandwidth 2D IR spectrum, encompassing both the Az and CO spectral regions, found no evidence of direct coupling between the two VDLs. In MbAzCO, both VDLs reported similar time scale motions: very fast homogeneous dynamics, fast, ∼1 ps dynamics, and dynamics on a much slower time scale. Therefore, each VDL reports independently on the protein dynamics and interactions, and the measured dynamics are reflective of the protein motions rather than intrinsic to the chemical nature of the VDL. The AzPhe VDL also permitted study of oxidized Mb dynamics, which could not be accessed previously with 2D IR spectroscopy. The experiments demonstrate that the combined application of 2D IR spectroscopy and site-specific incorporation of VDLs can provide information on dynamics, structure, and interactions at virtually any site throughout any protein.},

These conformations differ primarily in number of residues per turn and the hydrogen-bond registry between rungs of the helix. Using amide I 2D infrared (IR) and FTIR, we have demonstrated that it is possible to distinguish between the different conformers of gramicidin D in solution. We show that the spectra observed for this helical peptide bear no resemblance to the spectra of $\alpha$- or 310-helices and that while the FTIR spectra appear similar to spectra of $\beta$-sheets, 2D IR reveals that the observed resonances arise from vibrational modes unlike those observed in $\beta$-sheets. We also present an idealized model which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity. This model is able to explain the polarization-dependence of the experimental 2D IR data. Using this model, we show the coupling between the rungs of the helix dominates the spectra, and as a consequence of this, the number of residues per turn can greatly influence the amide I spectra of gramicidin D.},

However, in such works the determination of the limiting chemical shifts for the fully hydrogen-bonded state and for the non-hydrogen-bonded state is quite problematic, because they cannot be measured directly. In the present study, we carried out variable-temperature 1H NMR and IR measurements for N-methylacetamide in CDCl3 solution. We derived the expression for the limiting chemical shift for the fully hydrogen-bonded state as a function of IR band intensity and chemical shift. According to the equation, we determined the values of the limiting shifts at various temperatures. The present method may be applicable to other hydrogen-bonding systems.},

The resultant PVAc/c-PIL semi-IPN membranes exhibited good film-forming property and various phase separation morphologies, from spherical, interconnected to co-continuous microstructure. Also, the formation of semi-IPN structure endowed the membrane with an improved mechanical properties and slightly depressed glass transition temperatures. From gas permeation measurement results, PVAc/c-PIL semi-IPN membranes demonstrated gradually higher CO2 permeability coefficient with the increase of c-PIL content, while CO2/N2 permselectivity increased initially and then decreased slightly. The best permeability and permselectivity of the membrane reached 36.1 Barrer and 59.6, respectively, when the c-PIL content was 50wt%, which approached to the 2008 Robeson limit. Moreover, the permeability of CO2 in PVAc/c-PIL-50 semi-IPN membrane increased with increasing temperature across their glass transition temperatures, while the permselectivity of CO2/N2 decreased.},

abstract = {Interactions of ionic liquids (ILs) with water are of great interest for many potential IL applications. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (emim) acetate, in particular, has shown interesting interactions with water including hydrogen bonding and even chemical exchange. Previous studies have shown the unusual behavior of emim acetate when in the presence of 0.43 mole fraction of water, and a combination of NMR techniques is used herein to investigate the emim acetate-water system and the unusual behavior at 0.43 mole fraction of water. NMR relaxometry techniques are used to describe the effects of water on the molecular motion and interactions of emim acetate with water. A discontinuity is seen in nuclear relaxation behavior at the concentration of 0.43 mole fraction of water, and this is attributed to the formation of a hydrogen bonded network. EXSY measurements are used to determine the exchange rates between the H2 emim proton and water, which show a complex dependence on the concentration of the mixture. The findings support and expand our previous results, which suggested the presence of an extended hydrogen bonding network in the emim acetate-water system at concentrations close to 0.50 mole fraction of H2O.},

While (1)H NMR spectroscopy is found to probe very specifically the strongest hydrogen-bond interaction between the hydrogen attached to the C(2) position and the anion, a comparative XPS study provides first direct experimental evidence for cation-anion charge-transfer phenomena in ionic liquids as a function of the ionic liquid's anion. These charge-transfer effects are found to be surprisingly similar for [C(8)C(1)Im](+) and [C(8)C(1)C(1)Im](+) salts of the same anion, which in combination with theoretical calculations leads to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding and charge transfer occur independently from each other, but are both more pronounced for small and more strongly coordinating anions, and are greatly reduced in the case of large and weakly coordinating anions.},

The 1H NMR method for the PC, SPH, PE and PI species was validated according to the good laboratory practice (GLP) principles. The limits of detection and limits of quantification were below 0.0290 mg and 0.059 mg (300 mg sample weight), respectively. The coefficients of variation did not exceed 3.0% for PC and SPH and 10% for PE and PI and linearity was shown between 150 and 450 mg sample weight. The recovery was between 97.7% and 107.2% on average. Lorenz deconvolution, partial least squares (PLS) regression and independent component analysis (ICA) were successfully applied to extract PL signals in the case of spectral overlap. The root mean square error of prediction and the limit of quantification of the PLS model for PS were 0.026% w/w and 0.10% w/w, respectively. Other components (triacylglycerols, fatty acid, sterols, organic acids, carbohydrates, and inorganic cations) were additionally detected.

The temperature dependence of the stress relaxation time was compared with a free volume function calculated from specific volume data reported by Zoller by means of the Simha‐Somcynsky theory and with a fractional free volume measured by ortho‐positronium annihilation. We report in addition comparisons between free volume fractions extracted from volume data, and creep measurements for polystyrene, and stress relaxation data for poly(vinyl acetate) given by Kovacs et al., Schwarzl and Zahradnik, and Meyer et al. These investigations suggest that in the glassy state the Doolittle equation is valid only in isothermal aging experiments.

Here we review green solvents employed for carbon capture, with emphasis on ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents and liquid polymers. Solvent performance depends on temperature, density and viscosity. Deep eutectic solvents appear as the most advanced solvents with capacities reaching up to 4.292 g CO2 per g of solvent. Ionic liquids have shown CO2 uptakes of 4.72 mol of CO2/mol of solvent, but are less efficient on average. Liquid polymers display capacities of up to 1.357 mol of CO2/mol of solvent.},

abstract = {Charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) transitions have been the subject\nof a great deal of interest recently because they represent the simplest\npossible charge transfer reaction: The CTTS electron transfer from\nan atomic ion to a cavity in the surrounding solvent involves only\nelectronic degrees of freedom. Most of the work in this area, both\nexperimental and theoretical, has focused on aqueous halides. Experimentally,\nhowever, halides make a challenging choice for studying the CTTS\nphenomenon because the relevant spectroscopic transitions are deep\nin the UV and because the charge-transfer dynamics can be monitored\nonly indirectly through the appearance of the solvated electron.\nIn this paper, we show that these difficulties can be overcome by\ntaking advantage of the CTTS transitions in solutions of alkali metal\nanions, in particular, the near-IR CTTS band of sodide (Na-) in tetrahydrofuran\n(THF). Using femtosecond pump-probe techniques, we have been able\nto spectroscopically separate and identify transient absorption contributions\nnot only from the solvated electron, but also from the bleaching\ndynamics of the Na- ground state and from the absorption of the neutral\nsodium atom. Perhaps most importantly, we also have been able to\ndirectly observe the decay of the Na-* excited CTTS state, providing\nthe first direct measure of the electron transfer rate for any CTTS\nsystem. Taken together, the data at a variety of pump and probe wavelengths\nprovide a direct test for several kinetic models of the CTTS process.\nThe model which best fits the data assumes a delayed ejection of\nthe electron from the CTTS excited state in similar to 700 fs. Once\nejected, a fraction of the electrons, which remain localized in the\nvicinity of the neutral sodium parent atom, recombine on a similar\nto 1.5-ps time scale. The fraction of electrons that recombine depends\nsensitively on the choice of excitation wavelength, suggesting multiple\npathways for charge transfer. The spectrum of the neutral sodium\natom, which appears on the similar to 700-fs charge-transfer time\nscale, matches well with a species of stochiometry (Na+, e(-)) that\nhas been identified in the radiation chemistry literature. All the\nresults are compared to previous studies of both CTTS dynamics and\nalkali metal solutions, and the implications for charge transfer\nare discussed. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {Hydrogen bond dynamics of water in NaBr solutions are studied by using ultrafast 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy and polarization-selective IR pumpprobe experiments. The hydrogen bond structural dynamics are observed by measuring spectral diffusion of the OD stretching mode of dilute HOD in H2O in a series of high concentration aqueous NaBr solutions with 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy. The time evolution of the 2D IR spectra yields frequencyfrequency correlation functions, which permit quantitative comparisons of the influence of NaBr concentration on the hydrogen bond dynamics. The results show that the global rearrangement of the hydrogen bond structure, which is represented by the slowest component of the spectral diffusion, slows, and its time constant increases from 1.7 to 4.8 ps as the NaBr concentration increases from pure water to {approx}6 M NaBr. Orientational relaxation is analyzed with a wobbling-in-a-cone model describing restricted orientational diffusion that is followed by complete orientational randomization described as jump reorientation. The slowest component of the orientational relaxation increases from 2.6 ps (pure water) to 6.7 ps ({approx}6 M NaBr). Vibrational population relaxation of the OD stretch also slows significantly as the NaBr concentration increases.},

abstract = {A summary of the technical advances that are incorporated in the fourth major release of the Q-CHEM quantum chemistry program is provided, covering approximately the last seven years. These include developments in density functional theory methods and algorithms, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) property evaluation, coupled cluster and perturbation theories, methods for electronically excited and open-shell species, tools for treating extended environments, algorithms for walking on potential surfaces, analysis tools, energy and electron transfer modelling, parallel computing capabilities, and graphical user interfaces. In addition, a selection of example case studies that illustrate these capabilities is given. These include extensive benchmarks of the comparative accuracy of modern density functionals for bonded and non-bonded interactions, tests of attenuated second order M{\o}ller–Plesset (MP2) methods for intermolecular interactions, a variety of parallel performance benchmarks, and tests of the accuracy of implicit solvation models. Some specific chemical examples include calculations on the strongly correlated Cr 2 dimer, exploring zeolite-catalysed ethane dehydrogenation, energy decomposition analysis of a charged ter-molecular complex arising from glycerol photoionisation, and natural transition orbitals for a Frenkel exciton state in a nine-unit model of a self-assembling nanotube.},

abstract = {The virtual laboratory allows for computer experiments that are not accessible via real experiments. In this work, three previously obtained charge sets were employed to study the influence of hydrogen bonding on imidazolium-based ionic liquids in molecular dynamics simulations. One set provides diffusion coefficients in agreement with the experiment and is therefore a good model for real-world systems. Comparison with the other sets indicates hydrogen bonding to influence structure and dynamics differently. Furthermore, in one case the total charge was increased and in another decreased by 0.1 e. Both the most acidic proton as well as the corresponding carbon atom were artificially set to zero, sequentially and simultaneously. In the final setup a negative charge was placed on the proton in order to introduce a barrier for the anion to contact the cation via this most acidic hydrogen atom. The following observations were made: changing the hydrogen bonding ability strongly influences the structure while the dynamic properties, such as diffusion and viscosity, are only weakly changed. However, the introduction of larger alterations (stronger hydrogen bonding and antihydrogen bonding) also strongly influences the diffusion coefficients. The dynamics of the hydrogen bond, ion pairing, and the ion cage are all affected by the level of hydrogen bonding. A change in total charges predominantly influences transport properties rather than structure. For ion cage dynamics with respect to transport porperties, we find a good correlation and a weak or no correlation for the ion pair or the hydrogen bond dynamics, respectively. Nevertheless, the hydrogen bond does influence ion cage dynamics. Therefore, we confirm that ionic liquids rather consist of loosely interacting counterions than of discrete ion pairs. Hydrogen bonding affects the properties only in a secondary or indirect manner.},

abstract = {Using idealized models for parallel and antiparallel $\beta$ sheets, we calculate the linear and two-dimensional infrared spectra of the amide I vibration as a function of size and secondary structure. The model assumes transition–dipole coupling between the amide I oscillators in the sheet and accounts for the anharmonic nature of these oscillators. Using analytical and numerical methods, we show that the nature of the one-quantum vibrational eigenstates, which govern the linear spectrum, is, to a large extent, determined by the symmetry of the system and the relative magnitude of interstrand interactions. We also find that the eigenstates, in particular their trends with system size, depend sensitively on the secondary structure of the sheet. While in practice these differences may be difficult to distinguish in congested linear spectra, we demonstrate that they give rise to promising markers for secondary structure in the two-dimensional spectra. In particular, distinct differences occur between the spectra ...},

abstract = {Properties of the metal-water interface have been addressed by periodic density functional theory calculations, in particular with respect to the electronic and geometric structures of water bilayers on several transition metal surfaces. It will be demonstrated that the presence of the metal substrate leads to a significant polarization of the water bilayer. This causes a substantial water-induced reduction of the work function in spite of the weak water-metal interaction, but it is not associated with a significant change of the electronic structure of the metal substrates. The structure and the vibrational spectra of water bilayers at room temperatures have been studied performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations suggest that the water bilayer structure on noble metals is not stable at room temperature, whereas on more strongly interacting metal surfaces some ordering of the water layer persists. In addition, metal-water interfaces under electrochemical conditions, i.e. for charged metal substrates, are addressed. Our simulations show that the charging of the surface leads to characteristic changes in the wall-oxygen distribution and the vibrational spectra.},

abstract = {By adding a mid-infrared pulse shaper to a sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrometer, we have built a 2D SFG spectrometer capable of measuring spectra analogous to 2D IR spectra but with monolayer sensitivity and SFG selection rules. In this paper, we describe the experimental apparatus and provide an introduction to 2D SFG spectroscopy to help the reader interpret 2D SFG spectra. The main aim of this manuscript is to report 2D SFG spectra of the amyloid forming peptide FGAIL. FGAIL is a critical segment of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin) that aggregates in people with type 2 diabetes. FGAIL is catalyzed into amyloid fibers by many types of surfaces. Here, we study the structure of FGAIL upon deposition onto a gold surface covered with a self-assembled monolayer of methyl-4-mercaptobenzoate (MMB) that produces an ester coating. FGAIL deposited on bare gold does not form ordered layers. The measured 2D SFG spectrum is consistent with amyloid fiber formation, exhibiting both the parallel (a(+)) and perpendicular (a(-)) symmetry modes associated with amyloid $\beta$-sheets. Cross peaks are observed between the ester stretches of the coating and the FGAIL peptides. Simulations are presented for two possible structures of FGAIL amyloid $\beta$-sheets that illustrate the sensitivity of the 2D SFG spectra to structure and orientation. These results provide some of the first molecular insights into surface catalyzed amyloid fiber structure.},

In the experimental spectrum of C2C1Im DCA, a number of interesting vibrational signatures are found. Aside from the expected symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching bands of the cyano groups, a Fermi resonance of a combination band and a CN stretching normal mode is identified. The assignment is confirmed by a normal mode analysis of the AIMD based IR spectrum. The AIMD does not only predict the existence of the combination band but also seems to capture the frequency shift and intensity change caused by Fermi resonance. The interpretation of the experimental C2C1Im TCM spectrum is more straightforward as no resonance effects are found. The combination of experimental spectroscopy and advanced AIMD simulations is a very promising approach to gain new insights into the behavior of room-temperature ionic liquids.},

@article{Wong2019,
abstract = {In recent years, carbon capture technology has received much attention to limit the adverse effect caused by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. Membrane technology has risen as an attractive option for carbon capture as it is less energy–intensive and more environmentally friendly compared with adsorption, absorption, and cryogenic separation. Polymeric membranes dominate the gas separation industries as they are cheaper and easier to fabricate compared with inorganic membranes but are bound to the permeance-selectivity trade-off limitation. Recently, researchers have been modifying polymeric membrane by polymer blending and mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to overcome the limitation. Polymer blending yields a polymer blend that combines the benefits of two or more polymeric material. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyethersulfone (PES) are common polymeric materials used in the gas separation industry for membrane fabrication. PEG and PES were reviewed in this paper as potential polymer blends that efficiently separate CO2 due to their chemical characteristics. Another technique to overcome the trade-off limitation is fabricating MMMs that incorporate both polymeric membrane material and inorganic filler. However, MMM fabrication presents challenges such as polymer-filler incompatibility, void formation, and filler agglomeration due to unsuitable filler. Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-F) were reviewed as fillers that are able to overcome the dispersion and polymer-compatibility issues and increase the gas separation performance of membranes. Hence, MMM that is fabricated from PEG, PES, and MWCNTs-F that combines both polymer blending and MMM techniques is believed to be a breakthrough for CO2/N2 separation.},

Results from AIMD and empirical potential molecular dynamics (MD) have been compared and were found to differ in some respects. With a strong resemblance to the crystal, the AIMD simulated neat liquid exhibits many cation-anion hydrogen bonds, a feature that is almost absent in the MD results. The anions were observed to be strongly polarized in the condensed phase. The addition of CO2 increased the probability of this hydrogen bond formation. CO2 molecules in the vicinity of the ions of [bmim][PF6] exhibit larger deviations from linearity in their instantaneous configurations. The polar environment of the liquid induces a dipole moment in CO2, lifting the degeneracy of its bending mode. The calculated splitting in the vibrational mode compares well with infrared spectroscopic data. The solvation of CO2 in [bmim][PF6] is primarily facilitated by the anion, as seen from the radial and spatial distribution functions. CO2 molecules were found to be aligned tangential to the PF6 spheres with their most probable location being the octahedral voids of the anion. The structural data obtained from AIMD simulations can serve as a benchmark to refine interaction potentials for this important room-temperature ionic liquid.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted by the scientific community that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are leading to global climate change, notably an increase in global temperatures commonly referred to as global warming. The primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. As society's demand for energy increases and more CO2 is produced, it becomes imperative to decrease the amount emitted to the atmosphere. One promising approach to do this is to capture CO2 at the effluent of the combustion site, namely, power plants, in a process called postcombustion CO2 capture. Technologies to achieve this are heavily researched due in large part to the intuitive nature of removing CO2 from the stack gas and the ease in retrofitting existing CO2 sources with these technologies. As such, several reviews have been written on postcombustion CO2 capture. However, it is a fast-developing field, and the most recent review papers already do not include the state-of-the-art research. Notable among CO2 capture technologies are amine-based technologies. Amines are well-known for their reversible reactions with CO2, which make them ideal for the separation of CO2 from many CO2-containing gases, including flue gas. For this reason, this review will cover amine-based technology developed and published in and after the year 2013.},

Analysis was carried out to characterize a number of structural and dynamic properties. It is found that the hydrogen bonds are weaker than expected, as indicated by their short lifetimes, which is due to the fast rotational motion of anions. Transport properties such as ion diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivity were also measured on the basis of long trajectories, and good agreement was obtained with experimental results. The phenomenon that electrical conductivity of ionic liquids deviates from the Nernst-Einstein relation was well reproduced in our work. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that this deviation results from the correlated motion of cations and anions over time scales up to nanoseconds. In contrast, we find no evidence for long-lived ion-pairs migrating together.},

The spectra are well represented by a sum of a conductivity term and a relaxation spectral function that reflects an unsymmetrical relaxation time distribution. Parameter values are given for the Cole-Davidson term and the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts model. Molecular mechanisms in conformance with an unsymmetrical relaxation time distribution are discussed. The dominant relaxation process with a relaxation frequency in the accessible range can be explained by the formation of a small amount of dipolar ion complexes. The values for the extrapolated high-frequency permittivity indicate a further relaxation process, well above the frequency range of measurements, which is likely to reflect modes of motions of the cation and anion lattices relative to one another.},

abstract = {Localized orbitals are representations of electronic structure, which are easier to interpret than delocalized, canonical orbitals. While unitary transformations from canonical orbitals into localized orbitals have long been known, existing techniques maximize localization without regard to coupling between orbitals. Especially in conjugated $\pi$ spaces, orbitals are collapsed by unitary localization procedures into nonintuitive, strongly interacting units. Over-localization decreases interpretability, results in large values of interorbital coupling, and gives unmeaningful diagonal Fock energies. Herein, we introduce orbitals of intermediate localization that span between canonical and fully localized orbitals. To within a specified error, these orbitals preserve the diagonal nature of the Fock matrix while still introducing significant locality. In systems composed of molecular fragments, $\pi$ spaces can be localized into weakly coupled units. Importantly, as the weakly coupled orbitals separate, highly coupled orbitals maintain their expected structure. The resulting orbitals therefore correspond well to chemical intuition and maintain accurate orbital energies, making this procedure unique among existing orbital localization techniques. This article focuses on the formation and physical analysis of orbitals that smoothly connect the known fully delocalized and fully localized limits.},

abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that the local structure of liquid water has tetrahedral arrangements of molecules ordered by hydrogen bonds, the mechanism by which water molecules switch hydrogen-bonded partners remains unclear. In this mechanism, the role of nonhydrogen-bonded configurations (NHBs) between adjacent molecules is of particular importance. A molecule may switch hydrogen-bonding partners either (i) through thermally activated breaking of a hydrogen bond that creates a dangling hydrogen bond before finding a new partner or (ii) by infrequent but rapid switching events in which the NHB is a transition state. Here, we report a combination of femtosecond 2D IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of NHB species in an isotopically dilute mixture of HOD in D2O. Measured 2D IR spectra reveal that hydrogen-bonded configurations and NHBs undergo qualitatively different relaxation dynamics, with NHBs returning to hydrogen-bonded frequencies on the time scale of water's fastest intermolecular motions. Simulations of an atomistic model for the OH vibrational spectroscopy of water yield qualitatively similar 2D IR spectra to those measured experimentally. Analysis of NHBs in simulations by quenching demonstrates that the vast majority of NHBs are in fact part of a hydrogen-bonded well of attraction and that virtually all molecules return to a hydrogen-bonding partner within 200 fs. The results from experiment and simulation demonstrate that NHBs are intrinsically unstable and that dangling hydrogen bonds are an insignificant species in liquid water.},

Using the four organic molecules methanol, acetone, nitromethane, and pinacol as test systems, we compare the spectra from AIMD simulations of the isolated molecules in gas phase to static calculations relying on the harmonic approximation and to experimental spectra recorded in a nonpolar solvent. The AIMD approach turns out to give superior results when anharmonicity effects are of particular importance. Using the example of methanol, we demonstrate the application to bulk phase systems, which are not directly accessible by static calculations, but for which the AIMD spectra also provide a very good approximation to experimental data. Finally, we investigate the influence of simulation time and temperature in the AIMD on the resulting spectra.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to the volatile organic solvents. ILs which are made up of cationic and anionic components can be designed to possess a definite set of properties. In this context, the term “designer solvents” has been used to demonstrate the potential of these environment-friendly ILs in chemical reactions. Being designer solvents, they can be modulated to suit the reaction conditions, therefore earning the name “task specific ILs.” Since these liquids are able to dissolve several transition metal complexes, they have often been employed in recent times in several catalytic organic reactions to enhance reaction rates and selectivity. Though primarily used as solvents, they are now finding applications in various fields like catalysis, electrochemistry, spectroscopy, and material science to mention a few. ILs is capable to restrict many of the negative effects of the conventional organic solvents or other catalysts during catalytic reactions and have successfully been used in various catalytic areas affording high catalytic activity. The present review is aimed at exploring the structural characteristics, properties, preparation and applications of ILs in catalytic organic transformations.},

This close agreement with experiments at comparable resolution in space and time validates the individual MD trajectories. From 1,700 single-molecule trajectories, we identified and structurally characterized a conformational switch that directs dissociated ligands to one of two nearby protein cavities. Subsequent ligand migration proceeds through a network of transiently interconnected internal cavities, with passage between them involving correlated protein–ligand motions. The simulations also suggest how picosecond protein motions modulate the functional dissociation of oxygen and suppress the geminate recombination of toxic carbon monoxide.},

abstract = {We have studied the electrical conductivity of mixtures of the ionic liquid (IL) [C(2)mim][NTf(2)] with chloroform for various concentrations at a temperature of 303 K by both experiments and MD simulations. The molar conductivities exhibit an initial increase with decreasing IL concentration, which again sharply decreases in the region of highly diluted IL concentrations. This behavior is according to a competition between 1) the decreasing viscosity with increasing chloroform concentration due to fluidizing the mixture, and 2) the decreasing amount of charge carriers due to the formation of neutral IL aggregates. The simulated molar conductivities and their concentration dependence are found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined values, suggesting that essential correlations between the solvated ionic species in the solution are well represented. Both experiments and simulations show that the Nernst-Einstein relation drastically overestimates the conductivity of the solutions at low IL concentrations. According to our MD simulation data, this observation is due to the extensive formation of neutral aggregates in the low-concentration regime.},

Here, we show that the combinations of macromols. with ILs as solvents and additives could offer new progress, challenges, and opportunities in polymer materials science. Compatible binary systems, where ILs are solidified (gelled) by polymers, can be used as ion-conducting polymer electrolytes (ion gels). The ion transport in ion gels is found to be decoupled from the segmental motion of the polymers, leading to relatively high ionic conductivities even at their glass transition temps. The flexibility of the mol. design of ILs allows us to prep. many new ILs having electrochem. functionalities such as proton, electron, and lithium ion transport. The new ILs and their ion gels appear to be promising candidates as new materials for electrochem. applications. In contrast, certain combinations of macromols. in ILs exhibit lower or upper crit. soln. temp. type phase sepn. by changing the temp., where the phase sepn. temps. are easily altered by the change in the polymer and IL structures. Moreover, cross-linked polymer gels in the ILs show reversible vol. phase transition.

abstract = {Electrochemical recycling of carbon dioxide back to fuels and chemicals could be a viable method for CO2 remediation if the efficiency of the process could be improved. One of the key challenges, though, is that the faradaic efficiency is low in the presence of water because water electrolysis is much easier than CO2 electrolysis on most transition metal catalysts. Previous investigators have found that one can eliminate water conversion, by eliminating water from the system, but this has not proven to be practical. Here we present an alternate route, where EMIM-BF4 is used to suppress water electrolysis.We observe that the addition of water to 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4) actually increased the efficiency of CO2 conversion to CO. Indeed we find that little hydrogen is produced on silver in EMIM-Water solutions, provided the water concentration is no more than about 90% by mole.We observe an increase in rate of carbon monoxide (CO) production on silver and platinum as water is added to the electrolyte.We attribute this increase to the hydrolysis of tetrafluoroborate, which releases protons when mixed with water. Protons are shown to accelerate the reduction of CO2 until a critical mole fraction of water is reached. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Electrochemical Society},

The power spectrum is obtained from averaged atomic velocity autocorrelation functions. In order to characterize the response of these liquids upon external Coulomb perturbation, a diatomic probe is used in an electronic photo-excitation computational experiment.We find that the radial distribution functions that couple anions and cations are more structured when alkyl substituent chains are longer. We also find that diffusion constants for anions and their corresponding cations are highly correlated. Cavity distributions are nearly identical for all solvents studied. We find that large cavities, if present in the liquid, have very long lifetimes.

Gas molecules (CO2 and N2) in [VBIM]+-based PILs interact with polycations more strongly than with anions. Therefore, the role of anions in gas solubility is insignificant, which is in remarkable contrast to monomeric ILs. The solubilities predicted in the four PILs are close and in good agreement with available experimental data. The sorption, diffusion and permeation selectivities of CO2/N2 predicted from simulation are consistent with experiment. Particularly, the diffusion selectivities are approximately equal to one, implying that CO2/N2 separation is governed by sorption. This study provides atomistic insight into the mechanisms of gas sorption, diffusion and permeation in [VBIM]+-based PILs and reveals that polycations play a dominant role in determining gas-membrane interaction and separation.},

abstract = {We present mode-coupling equations for the description of the slow dynamics observed in supercooled molecular liquids close to the glass transition. The mode-coupling theory ?MCT? originally formulated to study the slow relaxation in simple atomic liquids, and then extended to the analysis of liquids composed by linear molecules, is here generalized to systems of arbitrarily shaped, rigid molecules. We compare the predictions of the theory for the q-vector dependence of the molecular nonergodicity parameters, calculated by solving numerically the molecular MCT equations in two different approximation schemes, with ‘‘exact'' results calculated from a molecular dynamics simulation of supercooled water. The agreement between theory and simulation data supports the view that MCT succeeds in describing the dynamics of supercooled molecular liquids, even for network forming ones},

abstract = {Despite technical advances in many areas of diagnostic radiology, the detection and imaging of human cancer remains poor. A meaningful impact on cancer screening, staging, and treatment is unlikely to occur until the tumor-to-background ratio improves by three to four orders of magnitude (ie, 103- to 104-fold), which in turn will require proportional improvements in sensitivity and contrast agent targeting. This review analyzes the physics and chemistry of cancer imaging and highlights the fundamental principles underlying the detection of malignant cells within a background of normal cells. The use of various contrast agents and radiotracers for cancer imaging is reviewed, as are the current limitations of ultrasound, x-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography (PET), and optical imaging. Innovative technologies are emerging that hold great promise for patients, such as positron emission mammography of the breast and spectroscopy-enhanced colonoscopy for cancer screening, hyperpolarization MRI and time-of-flight PET for staging, and ion beam-induced PET scanning and near-infrared fluorescence-guided surgery for cancer treatment. This review explores these emerging technologies and considers their potential impact on clinical care. Finally, those cancers that are currently difficult to image and quantify, such as ovarian cancer and acute leukemia, are discussed.},

These measurements facilitate a direct comparison with the widely adopted Kramers theory of condensed phase reaction kinetics, and for the first time avoid the significant complication of electronic excitation to probe directly in the time domain a ground electronic state reaction with a well-defined transition state. The picosecond timescale interconversion between two stable isomers of the metal carbonyl complex Co(2)(CO)(8) in a series of linear alkane solvents shows negligible energetic variation with solvent carbon chain length, providing an exclusive probe of the effects of solvent friction. Relative to the linear alkane series, cyclohexane does alter the potential energy surface by preferentially stabilizing one of the isomers. Despite this pronounced modification of the reaction barrier energetics, combination of experiment and computation enables the removal of the nondynamical barrier contribution to the rate constant, isolating the dynamical influence of solvent friction. The experimental data, supported with quantum and classical computations, show agreement with a simple Markovian Kramers theory for the isomerization rate constant's dependence on solvent viscosity.},

abstract = {Modified Cu electrodes were prepared by annealing Cu foil in air and electrochemically reducing the resulting Cu(2)O layers. The CO(2) reduction activities of these electrodes exhibited a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the Cu(2)O layer. Thin Cu(2)O layers formed by annealing at 130 °C resulted in electrodes whose activities were indistinguishable from those of polycrystalline Cu. In contrast, Cu(2)O layers formed at 500 °C that were ≥$\sim$3 $\mu$m thick resulted in electrodes that exhibited large roughness factors and required 0.5 V less overpotential than polycrystalline Cu to reduce CO(2) at a higher rate than H(2)O. The combination of these features resulted in CO(2) reduction geometric current densities >1 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials <0.4 V, a higher level of activity than all previously reported metal electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. Moreover, the activity of the modified electrodes was stable over the course of several hours, whereas a polycrystalline Cu electrode exhibited deactivation within 1 h under identical conditions. The electrodes described here may be particularly useful for elucidating the structural properties of Cu that determine the distribution between CO(2) and H(2)O reduction and provide a promising lead for the development of practical catalysts for electrolytic fuel synthesis.},

abstract = {Since the time of the industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO(2) concentration has risen by nearly 35 % to its current level of 383 ppm. The increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been suggested to be a leading contributor to global climate change. To slow the increase, reductions in anthropogenic CO(2) emissions are necessary. Large emission point sources, such as fossil-fuel-based power generation facilities, are the first targets for these reductions. A benchmark, mature technology for the separation of dilute CO(2) from gas streams is via absorption with aqueous amines. However, the use of solid adsorbents is now being widely considered as an alternative, potentially less-energy-intensive separation technology. This Review describes the CO(2) adsorption behavior of several different classes of solid carbon dioxide adsorbents, including zeolites, activated carbons, calcium oxides, hydrotalcites, organic-inorganic hybrids, and metal-organic frameworks. These adsorbents are evaluated in terms of their equilibrium CO(2) capacities as well as other important parameters such as adsorption-desorption kinetics, operating windows, stability, and regenerability. The scope of currently available CO(2) adsorbents and their critical properties that will ultimately affect their incorporation into large-scale separation processes is presented.},

The short polarization axis of the elliptical light acts as a phase-locked local oscillator field, heterodyning the chiral signal generated by the field along the long polarization axis. This leads to VCD signals that increase linearly with the ellipticity of the probe pulses and enhanced signal to noise, which is expected to improve recently reported transient VCD scans. An analogous scheme allows for vibrational optical rotary dispersion measurements.

abstract = {The approach to equilibrium between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate has been followed by zero-order kinetics both from the direction of CO2 hydration and HCO3- dehydration. The rates are monitored at 25.0 C using the stopped-flow indi- cator technique in H2O as well as D2O. The hydration of CO2 is subject to catalysis by H20 (k0 = 2.9 X 10-2 s-1) and OH- (kOH- = f_{+/-}kaOH- = 6.0 X 10^3 M-1 s-1). The value of 0.63 for the ratio kOH-/kOD- is consistent with a mechanism utilizing a direct nucleophilic attack of OH- on CO2. In the reverse direction HCO3- dehydration is catalyzed predominantly by H3O+ (kH3O+ = f_{+/-}kaH3O+ = 4.1 X 10^4 M-1 s-1) and to a much lesser degree by H2O (k0 = 2 X 10^{-4} s-1). The value of 0.56 for the ratio kH3O+/kD3O+ indicates that HCO3- may be protonated either in a preequilibrium step or in a rate-determining dehydra- tion step. Both the hydration of CO2 and the dehydration of bicarbonate are subject to general catalysis. For CO2, dibasic phosphate, a zinc imidazole complex, and a copper imidazole complex all enhanced the rate of hydration with respective rate coefficients of 3 X 10^{-1}, 6.0, and 2.5 M-1 s-1. For bicarbonate, monobasic phosphate catalyzed the rate of dehydration (kH2PO4- = 1 X 10-1 M-1 s-1). Additionally in going from an ionic strength of 0.1 to 1.0 there was a negligible salt effect for the water-catalyzed hydration of CO2. However, the rate constant for the hydronium ion catalyzed dehydration of HCO3- was reduced from 4.1 X 10^4 M-1 s-1 to 2.3 x 10^4 M-1 s-1 for the same change in ionic strength. Finally the rate of CO2 uptake by the complex Co(NH3)5OH2^{3+} was followed spectrophotometrically both in H2O and D2O to determine the solvent isotope effect for a reaction known to involve a nucleophilic attack of a Co(III)-hydroxo complex on CO2. A value of 1.0 for this iso- tope effect has interesting implications with respect to the mechanism of action of the metalloenzyme, carbonic anhydrase.},

abstract = {For theoreticians, ionic liquids represent a major challenge. This is due to the fact that intermolecular interactions are particularly strong because of ionic liquids' ionicity. This, in turn, causes a subtle interplay between different scales which is encoded in the measured macro- and mesoscopic properties and also in the molecular electrostatic characteristics. Therefore, force fields have to describe the microscopic processes correctly in order to reproduce macroscopic properties accurately over a large range of state variables. Herein, imidazolium-based ionic liquids were studied at different scales, going from the detailed quantum electronic scale to the classical atomistic scale. It is indicated how the information gained at each level could be used for the other scales. In particular, the issue of deriving suitable partial charges for use in classical force fields is addressed. The Bl{\"{o}}chl method was employed to generate partial charges reproducing the multipole distribution accurately for bulk systems. This led naturally to absolute ionic charges of less than |1 e|, i.e. charge scaling. So, the monopole structure of the herein introduced force field mimics the quantum chemical behaviour observed in the liquid phase. This led to a substantial improvement in the description of dynamical properties of immediate experimental interest, such as electric conductivity. For further insight, the electric dipole moment of the ions was taken as physical indicator of their electronic structure. The electric dipole moment was found to fluctuate strongly and to depend on polarisation. Hence, our scale-combined study offers a gateway to rational design of models, based on the relevant underlying physics rather than on mere numerical parameterisation, and thereby to (possibly) more direct physical interpretation of experimental results.},

The energy of the first-order vibrational excitation is strongly blueshifted with respect to the main band in the infrared or Raman spectra of water, indicating that water molecules with a highly weakened or broken donating hydrogen bond are correlated with the preedge structure in the x-ray absorption spectrum. The vibrational profile of preedge excited HDO water is well fitted with 50%±20% greater OH-stretch contribution compared to OD, which strongly supports a preference for OH being the weakened or broken H-bond in agreement with the well-known picture that D2O makes stronger H-bonds than H2O. Accompanying path-integral molecular dynamics simulations show that this is particularly the case for strongly asymmetrically H-bonded molecules, i.e., those that are selected by preedge excitation.},

abstract = {The crystal and molecular structure of a polymeric Cu(II)–orotate complex, [Cu($\mu$-HOr)(H2O)2]n, has been reinvestigated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. It is shown that several synergistic interactions: two axial Cu–O interactions; intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds; and $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking between the uracil rings contribute to the stability of the crystal structure. The Raman and FT-IR spectra of the title complex are reported for the first time. Comprehensive theoretical studies have been performed by using three unrestricted DFT methods: B3LYP; and the recently developed M06, and M05-2X density functionals. Clear-cut assignments of all the bands in the vibrational spectra have been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distribution, PED. The very strong Raman band at 1219cm−1 is diagnostic for the N1-deprotonation of the uracil ring and formation of the copper–nitrogen bond, in this complex. The Cu–O (carboxylate) stretching vibration is observed at 287cm−1 in the IR spectrum, while the Cu–N (U ring) stretching vibration is assigned to the strong Raman band at 263cm−1. The molecular structure and vibrational spectra (frequencies and intensities) calculated by the M06 functional method are very similar to the results obtained by the B3LYP method, but M06 performs better than B3LYP in calculations of the geometrical parameters and vibrational frequencies of the interligand O–H⋯O hydrogen bonding. Unfortunately, the M05-2X method seriously overestimates the strength of interligand hydrogen bond.},

@article{Robeson2008,
abstract = {The empirical upper bound relationship for membrane separation of gases initially published in 1991 has been reviewed with the myriad of data now presently available. The upper bound correlation follows the relationship Pi = k $\alpha$i jn, where Pi is the permeability of the fast gas, $\alpha$ij (Pi/Pj) is the separation factor, k is referred to as the "front factor" and n is the slope of the log-log plot of the noted relationship. Below this line on a plot of log $\alpha$ij versus log Pi, virtually all the experimental data points exist. In spite of the intense investigation resulting in a much larger dataset than the original correlation, the upper bound position has had only minor shifts in position for many gas pairs. Where more significant shifts are observed, they are almost exclusively due to data now in the literature on a series of perfluorinated polymers and involve many of the gas pairs comprising He. The shift observed is primarily due to a change in the front factor, k, whereas the slope of the resultant upper bound relationship remains similar to the prior data correlations. This indicates a different solubility selectivity relationship for perfluorinated polymers compared to hydrocarbon/aromatic polymers as has been noted in the literature. Two additional upper bound relationships are included in this analysis; CO2/N2 and N2/CH4. In addition to the perfluorinated polymers resulting in significant upper bound shifts, minor shifts were observed primarily due to polymers exhibiting rigid, glassy structures including ladder-type polymers. The upper bound correlation can be used to qualitatively determine where the permeability process changes from solution-diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Thio amino acids can be integrated into the backbone of peptides without significantly perturbing their structure. In this contribution we use ultrafast infrared and visible spectroscopy as well as state-of-the-art ab initio computations to investigate the photoisomerization of the trans form of N-methylthioacetamide (NMTAA) as a model conformational photoswitch. Following the S-2 excitation of trans-NMTAA in water, the return of the molecule into the trans ground state and the formation of the cis isomer is observed on a dual time scale, with a fast component of 8-9 ps and a slow time constant of similar to250 ps. On both time scales the probability of isomerization to the cis form is found to be 30-40%, independently of excitation wavelength. Ab initio CASPT2//CASSCF photochemical reaction path calculations indicate that, in vacuo, the trans --> cis isomerization event takes place on the S-1 and/or T-1 triplet potential energy surfaces and is controlled by very small energy barriers, in agreement with the experimentally observed picosecond time scale. Furthermore, the calculations identify one S-2/S-1 and four nearly isoenergetic S-1/S-0 conical intersection decay channels. In line with the observed isomerization probability, only one of the S-1/S-0 conical intersections yields the cis conformation upon S-1 --> S-0 decay. A substantially equivalent excited-state relaxation results from four T-1/S-0 intersystem crossing points.},

abstract = {We present time-resolved room-temperature infrared difference spectra for the bacteriorhodopsin (bR) photocycle at 8 cm(-1) spectral and 5 us temporal resolution, from 4000 to 800 cm-1. An in situ hydration method allowed for a controlled and stable sample hydration (92% relative humidity), largely improving the quality of the data without affecting the functionality of bR. Experiments in both (H2O)-O-16 and (H2O)-O-18 were conducted to assign bands to internal water molecules. Room-temperature difference spectra of the L and M intermediates minus the bR ground state (L-BR and M-BR, respectively) were comprehensively compared with their low-temperature counterparts. The room-temperature M-BR spectrum was almost identical to that obtained at 230 K, except for a continuum band. The continuum band contains water vibrations from this spectral comparison between (H2O)-O-16 and (H2O)-O-18, and no continuum band at 230 K suggests that the protein/solvent dynamics are insufficient for deprotonation of the water cluster. On the other hand, an intense positive broadband in the low-temperature L-BR spectrum (170 K) assigned to the formation of a water cavity in the cytoplasmic domain is absent at room temperature. This water cavity, proposed to be an essential feature for the formation of L, seems now to be a low-temperature artifact caused by restricted protein dynamics at 170 K. The observed differences between low- and room-temperature FTIR spectra are further discussed in light of previously reported dynamic transitions in bR. Finally, we show that the kinetics of the transient heat relaxation of bR after photoexcitation proceeds as a thermal diffusion process, uncorrelated with the photocycle itself.},

abstract = {The enol forms of the beta-diketones, benzoylacetones, have been studied using long-range carbon-hydrogen couplings involving the chelate OH proton, O1H chemical shifts, 13C chemical shifts and deuterium isotope effects on 13C chemical shifts. Studies were done in the temperature range from 268 to 181 K. The compounds are shown to be tautomeric, in opposition to a more symmetrical, delocalised, close to one-potential well structure as found in the solid at very low temperature. The same is true for dibenzoylmethane. The isotope effects on chemical shifts are very sensitive gauges of structure in these almost symmetrical systems. Equilibrium constants are determined and related to other similar compounds.},

abstract = {Charge transport rate is one of the key parameters determining the performance of organic electronic devices. Based on density functional theory, exchange-correlation functionals which adequately account for non-covalent interactions, such as M06-2X and wB97XD, should significantly improve the accuracy of charge transport rate calculations for large systems with non-covalent interactions. In this work, the B3LYP hybrid functional, the variant hybrid functional M06-2X, and the long-range-corrected wB97XD functional were used to perform geometry optimizations and charge transport rate calculations on 11 variants of tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m]coronene, including tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m]coronene itself and its tetra-substituted and octa-substituted derivatives. Our results indicate that the molecular geometries of these benzocoronene semiconductors are large quasi-planar conjugated $\pi$ systems, and the incorporation of different substituents significantly affects their frontier molecular orbitals. The hole carrier mobility (µ+) and electron carrier mobility (µ?) of the methoxy-substituted derivatives (TBC(OCH3)4 and TBC(OCH3)8) were relatively low. The results of the tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m]coronene molecules studied were consistent with using the aforementioned M06-2X, wB97XD, and B3LYP methods. We found that the octa-substituted derivatives (TBCF8, TBCCl8, TBC(CH3)8, and TBC(CN)8) could be used as p-type organic semiconductor materials.},

abstract = {Excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of pyranine (8-hydroxypyranine-1,3,6-trisulfonate, HPTS) in room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) mixed micelles is studied by femtosecond up-conversion. The mixed micelle consists of a triblock copolymer, (PEO)(20)-(PPO)(70)-(PEO)(20) (Pluronic P123), and one of the two RTILs, 1-pentyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide ([pmim][Br]) and 1-pentyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetra-fluoroborate ([pmim][BF(4)]). The size and structure of the mixed micelle vary with the relative amount of the RTIL. For [pmim][Br], the hydrodynamic diameter of the mixed micelle is 26 nm in 0.3 M RTIL and 3500 nm in 3.0 M RTIL. The time constant of initial proton transfer ($\tau$(PT)) in P123 micelle (65 ps) is 10 times slower than that (5 ps) in water, while the time constants of recombination ($\tau$(rec)) and dissociation ($\tau$(diss)) are 2-3 times slower in P123 micelle. On addition of the RTIL, the rate of ESPT is markedly modified. In 0.3 M RTIL-P123 mixed micelle, $\tau$(PT) is shorter than that in P123 micelle. In the mixed micelle, $\tau$(PT) increases with an increase in the concentration of the RTIL (230 ps in 3 M [pmim][Br] and 55 ps in 0.9 M [pmim][BF(4)]). This is attributed to large scale penetration of the P123 micelle by RTIL replacing water molecules. The time constants of proton transfer ($\tau$(PT), $\tau$(rec), and $\tau$(diss)) are faster than the slowest component (200-500 ps) of solvation dynamics. It seems that the ultrafast component of solvation (<0.3 ps and <5 ps) is enough for inducing proton transfer. The time constant of the proton transfer ($\tau$(PT)) in [pmim][BF(4)]-P123 mixed micelle is longer (∼20%) than that in [pmim][Br]-P123 mixed micelle for the same concentration of RTIL. The counterion dependence of ESPT is attributed to the difference in the structure and greater hydrophobicity of the [pmim][BF(4)].},

abstract = {An important step toward understanding the mechanism of the PrP(C)-to-PrP(Sc) conversion is to elucidate the folding pathway(s) of the prion protein. On the basis of stopped-flow measurements, we recently proposed that the prion protein folds via a transient intermediate formed on the submillisecond time scale, and mutations linked to familial diseases result in a pronounced increase in the population of this intermediate. Here, we have extended these studies to continuous-flow measurements using a capillary mixing system with a time resolution of approximately 100 micros. This allowed us to directly observe two distinct phases in folding of the recombinant human prion protein 90-231, providing unambiguous evidence for rapid accumulation of an early intermediate (with a time constant of approximately 50 micros), followed by a rate-limiting folding step (with a time constant of approximately 700 micros). The present study also clearly demonstrates that the population of the intermediate is significantly increased at mildly acidic pH and in the presence of urea. A similar three-state folding behavior was observed for the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease-associated F198S mutant, in which case the population of an intermediate was greatly increased as compared to that of the wild-type protein. Overall, the present data strongly suggest that this partially structured intermediate may be a direct monomeric precursor of the misfolded PrP(Sc) oligomer.},

The H2 evolution and the subsequent pH variation were observed to determine the reaction kinetic parameters and characterize the hydrolysis intermediates, i.e. the hydroxyborates BH4-z(OH)z -, by XRD, IR and 11B NMR. It was found that: (i) the apparent activation energy of the reaction was 98 ± 10 kJ mol-1 and the reaction order versus the initial NaBH4 concentration was 0; (ii) all of the reactions BH4 - → BH3(OH)-, BH 3(OH)- → BH2(OH)2 -, BH2(OH)2 - → BH(OH)3 - and BH(OH)3 - → B(OH)4 - took place simultaneously; (iii) only 25 mol% of B(OH)4 - and 75 mol% of BH4 - were found at 25% of conversion; (iii) the hydroxyborates are very short-lived intermediates and only traces of BH 3(OH)- were detected. {\textcopyright} 2010 Professor T.

abstract = {Thermally induced gauche–trans isomerization and direct solute–solvent interactions of the solute, ethyl isocyanate (EIC), in the solvent, 2-methylpentane (2MP), are investigated using ultrafast infrared vibrational echo experiments and linear vibrational absorption spectroscopy of the isocyanate (N=C=O) antisymmetric stretching mode (2278 cm−1). Both the EIC vibrational echo measured pure vibrational dephasing and the absorption spectra show complex behavior as a function of temperature from room temperature to 8 K. The EIC data are compared to absorption experiments on the same mode of isocyanic acid (HNCO), which cannot undergo isomerization. To describe the observations, a model is presented that involves both intramolecular dynamics and intermolecular dynamical interactions. At room temperature, gauche–trans isomerization is very fast, and the isomerization dynamics contribution to the vibrational echo decay and the absorption line shape is small because it is motionally narrowed. The dominant contribution to both the vibrational echo decay and the absorption spectrum is from direct dynamical interactions of the solute with the solvent. As the temperature is lowered, the direct contribution to vibrational dephasing decreases rapidly, but the contribution from isomerization increases because the extent of motional narrowing diminishes. The combined effect is a very gradual decrease of the rate of pure dephasing as the temperature is initially lowered from room temperature. At very low temperature, below the 2MP glass transition, isomerization cannot occur. The absorption spectrum displays two peaks, interpreted as the distinct gauche and trans absorption bands. Even at 8 K, the pure dephasing is surprisingly fast. The direct solvent-induced dephasing is negligible. The dephasing is caused by motions of the ethyl group without isomerization occuring. At intermediate temperatures (150 K>T>100 K),(150 K>T>100 K), isomerization takes place, but its contribution to the pure dephasing is not motionally narrowed. The absorption spectral shapes are complex. Dephasing arising from direct interaction with the solvent is small. Both isomerization and fluctuations on the gauche–trans surface contribute to the absorption line shape. The model that is used to describe the results involves a NMR type exchange calculation with additional contributions from the direct solvent interactions that are obtained from the temperature-dependent HNCO IR spectra. From the temperature dependence of the isomerization “jump” rate, the barrier height for the isomerization is found to be ∼400 cm−1.},

Water has been shown to play an important role in the dynamics of small biological systems, for example when trapped in hydrophobic regions, but the molecular details of water have generally been thought dispensable when considering large membrane interfaces. Nevertheless, spectroscopic data indicate that water has distinct, ordered behavior near membrane surfaces. While coarse-grained simulations have achieved success recently in aiding understanding the dynamics of membrane assemblies, it is natural to ask, does the missing chemical nature of water play an important role? We have therefore performed atomic-resolution simulations of vesicle fusion to understand the role of chemical detail, particularly the molecular structure of water, in membrane fusion and at membrane interfaces more generally. These membrane interfaces present a form of hydrophilic confinement, yielding surprising, non-bulk-like water behavior.},

Solid adsorbents are a potential method to capture CO(2), but the sorbent-sorbate affinity is critical in determining the energetic viability of such processes. In this study, the adsorption of CO(2) in a range of microporous organic polymers was tested. These materials adsorb up to 2.20 mmol/g CO(2) at 298 K and 1 bar, and thus performance is compared with related porous solids in the literature. The relationship between CO(2) uptake and apparent surface area and pore size is described, and this showed that heats of adsorption were important in the low pressure regime. The chemical tuning of gas-sorbent affinity provides a blueprint for the development of improved materials in this area.},

The imidazolium cations included 1-heptyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-3-methylimidazolium, 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1,3-dibenzylimidazolium, and 1-(2-naphthylmethyl)-3-methylimidazolium. Structure–property relationships were investigated regarding the substituent effects on the imidazolium cation, including n-alkyl versus cycloalkyl and aromatic versus aliphatic, as well as the effects of cation symmetry and larger aromatic polycyclic functionalities. Thermophysical properties investigated include density, thermal transition temperatures, and decomposition temperatures. The densities of the ionic liquids are governed by the substituents on the cation: n-alkyl < cycloalkyl < aromatic. The group contribution method is applicable for the density estimation of ionic liquids, and the volume parameters for cyclohexyl, phenyl, and naphthyl groups are reported. The glass transition temperature (Tg) follows the same systematic trend due to substituent flexibility: n-alkyl < cycloalkyl < aromatic. Thermal stability as measured by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is not strongly affected by the substituents on the imidazolium ring; however, slight differences are observed with the higher Tg ionic liquids having lower decomposition temperatures for this series of ionic liquids. On the other hand, the cyclohexylmethyl-substituted ionic liquid exhibits a higher activation energy for degradation than the other ionic liquids based on isothermal TGA, and all ionic liquids studied show significant weight loss at 300 °C indicating that appreciable decomposition can occur at temperatures substantially lower than the onset temperature observed in dynamic TGA scans.},

abstract = {Two novel 2′-deoxyadenosine (dA) analogues, Si2–dA–SCN and Si2–dA–SeCN, and two novel phenylalanine (Phe) analogues, Boc–Me–PheCH2SCN and Boc–Me–PheCH2SeCN, have been synthesized and the thiocyanate (SCN) and selenocyanate (SeCN) functional groups evaluated as vibrational reporters. The syntheses of Si2–dA–SCN and Si2–dA–SeCN were accomplished in three steps in 16% and 32% overall yields, respectively, and the syntheses of Boc–Me–PheCH2SCN and Boc–Me–PheCH2SeCN were completed in four steps in 8.9% and 2.3% overall yields, respectively. The SCN and SeCN stretch vibrational modes were shown to be sensitive to the local environment by frequency shifts and full-width half-maximum (fwhm) changes in response to tetrahydrofuran (THF) and THF/water solvent mixtures. The vibrational lifetimes of the Si2–dA–SeCN (237 ± 12 ps) and Boc–Me–PheCH2SeCN (295 ± 31 ps) in THF solution were determined by ultrafast infrared pump-probe spectroscopy to be 1.5 to 3 times longer than those for Si2–dA–SCN (140 ± 6 ps) and Boc–Me–PheCH2SCN (102 ± 4 ps). The longer lifetimes for the SeCN analogues were attributed to the better insulating effects of the heavier selenium atom compared to the sulfur atom. The solvent sensitivity and longer vibrational lifetimes compared to other vibrational reporters suggest that SCN and SeCN vibrational reporters are well suited to studying several dynamic processes including protein and nucleic acid hydration and conformational changes, however stability issues may require post-synthetic modification methods to incorporate these reporters into biomacromolecules.},

abstract = {Although a functional role in copper binding has been suggested for the prion protein, evidence for binding at affinities characteristic of authentic metal-binding proteins has been lacking. By presentation of copper(II) ions in the presence of the weak chelator glycine, we have now characterized two high-affinity binding sites for divalent transition metals within the human prion protein. One is in the N-terminal octapeptide-repeat segment and has a K(d) for copper(II) of 10(-14) M, with other metals (Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+)) binding three or more orders of magnitude more weakly. However, NMR and fluorescence data reveal a previously unreported second site around histidines 96 and 111, a region of the molecule known to be crucial for prion propagation. The K(d) for copper(II) at this site is 4 x 10(-14) M, whereas nickel(II), zinc(II), and manganese(II) bind 6, 7, and 10 orders of magnitude more weakly, respectively, regardless of whether the protein is in its oxidized alpha-helical (alpha-PrP) or reduced beta-sheet (beta-PrP) conformation. A role for prion protein (PrP) in copper metabolism or transport seems likely and disturbance of this function may be involved in prion-related neurotoxicity.},

abstract = {Determining the thermal history of a semicrystalline polymer is an area of extreme importance when it comes to understanding the structure‐propety relationships. For nylon 6 film and fiber products, we have shown that techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermomechanical analysis (TMA), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) can reveal the thermal history of the polymer. We believe that the basis of correlation between the heat setting (annealing) conditions and the thermal/mechanical data is the formation of microcrystallites within the amorphous phase upon thermal treatment. Based on a previously published X‐ray study, we must mention that a number of changes within the crystalline phase also occur concurrently during the heat setting process of nylon 6. DMA of a highly annealed nylon 6 has helped us identify a broad $\alpha$‐relaxation in the vicinity of 170°C, tentatively assigned to the mobility of interfacial amorphous domains. We propose that the occurrence of $\alpha$‐relaxation parallels the crystalline phase changes observed in X‐ray studies during the heat setting of nylon 6 products. Although most of the work presented in this manuscript is based on nylon 6, the proposed correlation between the thermal history and DSC/TMA/DMA techniques can be expected for any semicrystalline polymeric film or fiber.

Hydrogenated and deuterated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG and dDPPG) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG), were used in the experiments to represent gel-phase and fluid-phase lipid bilayers, respectively. Our SFG results indicated that Pep-1 molecules adopted a $\beta$-sheet conformation when adsorbed to the surface of gel-phase DPPG lipid bilayers. When interacting with fluid-phase POPG lipid bilayers, Pep-1 adopted a mix of $\alpha$-helical and $\beta$-sheet structures over a broad range of peptide concentrations. The orientation distribution of the $\alpha$-helical Pep-1 segment associated with the fluid-phase bilayers was found to depend on the peptide concentration. SFG orientation analysis showed that Pep-1 molecules adopted an orientation nearly perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer for peptide concentrations of 0.28 $\mu$M and 1.4 $\mu$M. When the Pep-1 concentration was increased to 7.0 $\mu$M, combined SFG and ATR-FTIR measurements showed that Pep-1 molecules were associated with the bilayer with a broad orientation distribution. Our results demonstrated that lipid bilayer phase and peptide concentration affect the conformation and orientation of Pep-1 molecules associated with model cell membranes, which is crucial to the translocation process of CPPs. A combination of SFG and ATR-FTIR studies can be used to determine the conformation and orientation of CPPs interacting with model cell membranes in situ.},

abstract = {Recent reports of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) X-ray structures, including the structure of CXCR4 chemokine receptor, have advanced the aim of elucidating with chemical precision GPCR ligand binding, activation and interactions. Structure-based drug design is also becoming increasingly important as a tool to find new GPCR-targeted drugs. As new structural information becomes available, complementary experimental strategies are required to address questions related to receptor dynamics and organization in membranes. To this end, the introduction of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into GPCR ligands and expressed receptors has opened up new opportunities to study GPCRs in native systems. Because UAAs can contain a wide range of chemically diverse functional groups, genetic incorporation of UAAs into proteins provides an important new tool of chemical biology to the study of GPCRs, including chemokine receptors. For example, UAAs enable the incorporation of spectroscopic probes and functional groups for selective chemical modification that facilitates studies of (real-time) protein dynamics and interactions. In this review, we highlight recent methods developed to use UAAs to study chemokine receptors and we describe examples of their use to probe chemokine receptor function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We report on a comparative femtosecond infrared study of the bimolecular proton transfer reaction dynamics of the photoacid pyranine (8-hydroxy-13,6-trisulfonate-pyrene, abbreviated as HPTS) with the family of carboxylate bases -OOCCH(3-x)Clx (x = 0-3) in aqueous solution. We use a generalized reaction model consisting of n proton transfer reaction pathways between photoacid and base, each pathway characterized by the number n of water molecules functioning as solvent switch facilitating an efficient transfer. The dynamics of the different proton transfer pathways have been followed by inspection of appropriate vibrational modes marking the progress of the reaction, and allow the direct observation of the transient relay mechanism of proton through one bridging water molecule in a loose photoacid-base configuration of the type HPTS-center dot center dot center dot H3O+center dot center dot center dot-OOCCH(3-x) Cl-x (x = 0-3). By applying a global fit procedure on the n-coupled reaction pathways, with full reversibility and detailed balance, we find for the reaction series that the encounter complex formed after mutual diffusion between photoacid and base, and subsequent desolvation, follows in general the loose complex pathway with one water molecule bridging acid and base. Only for the weakest base studied, trichloroacetate, larger solvent switches with n >= 2 water molecules are important in the transfer dynamics. Whereas transfer in the tight complex with no water spacer (n = 0) occurs within time resolution of 150 fs, the transfer in the loose (n = 1) complex proceeds in a sequential fashion where the first transfer occurs within time resolution, irrespective of base strength, whereas the second transfer from the water to the base is activated and conforms to a correlation between free energy and reaction rate.

abstract = {When supercritical CO2 is dissolved in an ionic liquid, its partial molar volume is much smaller than that observed in most other solvents. In this article we explore in atomistic detail and explain in an intuitive way the peculiar volumetric behavior experimentally observed when supercritical CO2 is dissolved in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim+] [PF6(-)]). We also provide physical insight into the structure and dynamics occurring across the boundary of the CO2 ionic liquid interface. We find that the liquid structure of [Bmim+] [PF6(-)] in the presence of CO2 is nearly identical to that in the neat ionic liquid (IL) even at fairly large mole fractions of CO2. Our simulations indicate, in agreement with experiments, that partial miscibilities of one fluid into the other are very unsymmetrical, CO2 being highly soluble in the ionic liquid phase while the ionic liquid is highly insoluble in the CO2 phase. We interpret our results in terms of the size and shape of spontaneously forming cavities in the ionic liquid phase, and we propose that CO2 occupies extremely well-defined locations in the IL. Even though our accurate prediction of cavity sizes in the neat IL indicates that these cavities are small compared with the van der Waals radius of a single carbon or oxygen atom, CO2 appears to occupy a space that was for the most part a priori "empty".},

abstract = {Rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten human society, the natural environment, and the synergy between the two. In order to ameliorate the CO2 problem, carbon capture and conversion techniques have been proposed. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials, a relatively new class of porous materials with unique structural features, high surface areas, chemical tunability and stability, have been extensively studied with respect to their applicability to such techniques. Recently, it has become apparent that the CO2 capture capabilities of MOF-based materials significantly boost their potential toward CO2 conversion. Furthermore, MOF-based materials' well-defined structures greatly facilitate the understanding of structure-property relationships and their roles in CO2 capture and conversion. In this review, we provide a comprehensive account of significant progress in the design and synthesis of MOF-based materials, including MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives, and their application to carbon capture and conversion. Special emphases on the relationships between CO2 capture capacities of MOF-based materials and their catalytic CO2 conversion performances are discussed.},

The associated energy gap dynamics can be probed by using various nonlinear optical spectroscopies. We discuss various forms of photon echo--time-integrated, time-gated, and heterodyne-detected photon echo--as well as Fourier transform spectral interferometry. It is shown that for solutions of the dye molecule DTTCI, a system-bath correlation function can be acquired that provides a quantitative description of all (non)linear spectroscopic experiments. The deduced correlation function is projected onto the multimode Brownian oscillator model, which allows for a physical interpretation of the multiple-time correlation function and a determination of the spectral density relevant to the solvation process. The following applications of photon echo to condensed phase dynamics are discussed: enhanced vibrational mode suppression, Liouville pathways interference, and dynamical Stokes shift. Recent results of echo-peak shift experiments on the hydrated electron are also presented. The review concludes that photon echo should be useful as a novel tool to explore transition state dynamics.},

Presently, lasers capable of generating terawatt peak powers with unprecedented short pulse duration can now be built on a single optical table in a small-scale laboratory, while large-scale lasers can generate peak power of over a petawatt. This progress is made possible by the use of the chirped-pulse amplification technique, combined with the use of broad-bandwidth laser materials such as Ti:sapphire, and the development of techniques for generating and propagating very short (10–30 fs) duration light pulses. We also briefly summarize some of the new scientific advances made possible by this technology, such as the generation of coherent femtosecond x-ray pulses, and the generation of MeV-energy electron beams and high-energy ions.},

abstract = {Singlet–triplet (S0–T1) well-to-well (WWES–T) and adiabatic (AES–T) excitation energies of benzene and the linear polyacenes naphthalene through decacene were estimated using a range of density functional theory (DFT) methods and basis sets along with the assumption of a closed-shell singlet state. Via single exponential decay regression based extrapolations to the polymeric limit, significant variability in theoretically obtained WWES–T/AES–T predicted for longer polyacenes is evident that is primarily dependent on the model chemistry employed, with minor variations due to basis set incompleteness and zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections. With the exception of the B2PLYPD density functional (which, along with the mPW2PLYPD functional, combines exact HF exchange with an MP2-like correlation to the DFT calculation), all DFT methods investigated predict a negative WWES–T/AES–T (ground state triplet) at the polymer limit, with most functionals predicting a transition from a singlet to triplet ground state between octacene and decacene. Extrapolation of the B2PLYPD results predicts a vanishingly small singlet–triplet gap at the polymeric limit for an infinitely long homolog. Hartree–Fock calculations significantly underestimate the polyacene WWES–T/AES–T, whereas MPn methods overestimate the singlet–triplet gap but display a convergence toward experimental values with increasing truncation order and substitutions. The B2PLYPD and mPW2PLYPD functionals appear to balance the WWES–T/AES–T underestimating tendency of HF/DFT methods for longer polyacenes against the propensity for MPn methods to overestimate the WWES–T/AES–T for these compounds, and predict all acenes from benzene through decacene will be ground state singlets with positive singlet–triplet gaps.},

Surface tension, charge density on the electrode surface, and capacitance decrease with increasing the addition of OMIBF4 in EMIBF4, which has been found to be the consequence of the preferential adsorption of the octyl group on the Hg surface and increasing extent of heterogeneity of the mixtures. The continuous widening of the electrocapillary maxima (ECM) with increasing addition of OMIBF4 in EMIBF4 also supports the above reasoning. In accordance with the ECM, the potential corresponding to the minimum of the capacitance−potential curve is assigned as the potential of zero charge (PZC). The probable cause for the appearance of the PZC at the minimum of the capacitance−potential curve has been discussed.},

High-energy X-ray scattering studies reveal a persistence of the characteristic features of ionic liquid structure even for 80% dilution with n-C6D14. Nuclear magnetic resonance self-diffusion results reveal decidedly non-hydrodynamic behavior where the self-diffusion of the neutral, non-polar n-C6D14 is on average a factor of 21 times faster than for the cation.

abstract = {Plasticization and physical aging due to the undesirable deformation of chain microstructure under high pressure or long-term operation hamper the practical application of polymer membranes. Fixing the polymer chain architecture without sacrificing the internal free volume and thereby the membrane permeability remains a grand challenge. The venation architecture in plant leaf, featured by its stable vein structure with abundant interveinal spaces, offers us an inspiration for designing a highly permeable and stable chain architecture. Here, we construct a venation-like chain architecture in polyphenylene oxide (PPO) membrane by introducing numerous interchain crosslinking bridges using Friedel-Crafts-based hypercrosslinking reaction. These crosslinking bridges rigidify the chains and prevent them from dense packing, inhibiting the microstructural deformation, while simultaneously generating abundant free volume. The resulting membranes display ultrahigh CO2 permeability of 5130 Barrer (73-fold higher than pristine PPO membrane), along with superior structural stability. Particularly, the plasticization is fully suppressed under high pressure even up to 70 bar and the physical aging-induced loss of CO2 permeability is reduced remarkably down to as low as 19% after 360 days, transcending most of the state-of-the-art membranes. This venation-like chain architecture opens a new avenue to solving the current permeability-stability dilemma for the implementation of polymer membrane technology.},

abstract = {We describe the behavior of the conductivity, viscosity, and vapor pressure of various binary liquid systems in which proton transfer occurs between neat Br{\"{o}}nsted acids and bases to form salts with melting points below ambient. Such liquids form an important subgroup of the ionic liquid (IL) class of reaction media and electrolytes on which so much attention is currently being focused. Such "protic ionic liquids" exhibit a wide range of thermal stabilities. We find a simple relation between the limit set by boiling, when the total vapor pressure reaches one atm, and the difference in pK(a) value for the acid and base determined in dilute aqueous solutions. For DeltapK(a) values above 10, the boiling point elevation becomes so high (>300 degrees C) that preemptive decomposition prevents its measurement. The completeness of proton transfer in such cases is suggested by the molten salt-like values of the Walden product, which is used to distinguish good from poor ionic liquids. For the good ionic liquids, the hydrogen bonding of acid molecules to the proton-transfer anion is strong enough that boiling points, but not melting points, may maximize at the hydrogen-bonded dianion composition. High boiling liquids of this type constitute an interesting class of high-temperature protonic acid that may have high-temperature fuel cell applications.},

abstract = {Within the framework of green chemistry, solvents occupy a strategic place. To be qualified as a green medium, these solvents have to meet different criteria such as availability, non-toxicity, biodegradability, recyclability, flammability, and low price among others. Up to now, the number of available green solvents are rather limited. Here we wish to discuss a new family of ionic fluids, so-called Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), that are now rapidly emerging in the current literature. A DES is a fluid generally composed of two or three cheap and safe components that are capable of self-association, often through hydrogen bond interactions, to form a eutectic mixture with a melting point lower than that of each individual component. DESs are generally liquid at temperatures lower than 100 °C. These DESs exhibit similar physico-chemical properties to the traditionally used ionic liquids, while being much cheaper and environmentally friendlier. Owing to these remarkable advantages, DESs are now of growing interest in many fields of research. In this review, we report the major contributions of DESs in catalysis, organic synthesis, dissolution and extraction processes, electrochemistry and material chemistry. All works discussed in this review aim at demonstrating that DESs not only allow the design of eco-efficient processes but also open a straightforward access to new chemicals and materials.},

In addition, non-linear infrared spectroscopic techniques make it possible to examine intra- and intermolecular interactions and how such interactions evolve on very fast time scales, but also in some instances on very slow time scales. Ultrafast Infrared Vibrational Spectroscopy is an advanced overview of the field of ultrafast infrared vibrational spectroscopy based on the scientific research of the leading figures in the field. The book discusses experimental and theoretical topics reflecting the latest accomplishments and understanding of ultrafast infrared vibrational spectroscopy. Each chapter provides background, details of methods, and explication of a topic of current research interest. Experimental and theoretical studies cover topics as diverse as the dynamics of water and the dynamics and structure of biological molecules. Methods covered include vibrational echo chemical exchange spectroscopy, IR-Raman spectroscopy, time resolved sum frequency generation, and 2D IR spectroscopy. Edited by a recognized leader in the field and with contributions from top researchers, including experimentalists and theoreticians, this book presents the latest research methods and results. It will serve as an excellent resource for those new to the field, experts in the field, and individuals who want to gain an understanding of particular methods and research topics.},

abstract = {Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are nonvolatile, tunable solvents that have generated significant interest across a wide variety of engineering applications. The use of RTILs as media for CO2 separations appears especially promising, with imidazolium-based salts at the center of this research effort. The solubilities of gases, particularly CO2, N2, and CH4, have been studied in a number of RTILs. Process temperature and the chemical structures of the cation and anion have significant impacts on gas solubility and gas pair selectivity. Models based on regular solution theory and group contributions are useful to predict and explain CO2 solubility and selectivity in imidazolium-based RTILs. In addition to their role as a physical solvent, RTILs might also be used in supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) as a highly permeable and selective transport medium. Performance data for SILMs indicates that they exhibit large permeabilities as well as CO2/N2 selectivities that outperform many polymer membranes. Furthermore, the greatest potential of RTILs for CO2 separations might lie in their ability to chemically capture CO2 when used in combination with amines. Amines can be tethered to the cation or the anion, or dissolved in RTILs, providing a wide range of chemical solvents for CO2 capture. However, despite all of their promising features, RTILs do have drawbacks to use in CO2 separations, which have been overlooked as appropriate comparisons of RTILs to common organic solvents and polymers have not been reported. A thorough summary of the capabilities—and limitations—of imidazolium-based RTILs in CO2-based separations with respect to a variety of materials is thus provided.},

abstract = {We present a new approach that combines electronic structure methods and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the infrared spectroscopy of condensed phase systems. This approach is applied to the OH stretch band of dilute HOD in liquid D2O and the OD stretch band of dilute HOD in liquid H2O for two commonly employed models of water, TIP4P and SPC/E. Ab initio OH and OD anharmonic transition frequencies are calculated for 100 HOD.(D2O)(n) and HOD.(H2O)(n) (n =4-9) clusters randomly selected from liquid water simulations. A linear empirical relationship between the ab initio frequencies and the component of the electric field from the solvent along the bond of interest is developed. This relationship is used in a molecular dynamics simulation to compute frequency fluctuation time-correlation functions and infrared absorption line shapes. The normalized frequency fluctuation time-correlation functions are in good agreement with the results of previous theoretical approaches. Their long-time decay times are 0.5 ps for the TIP4P model and 0.9 ps for the SPC/E model, both of which appear to be somewhat too fast compared to recent experiments. The calculated line shapes are in good agreement with experiment, and improve upon the results of previous theoretical approaches. The methods presented are simple, and transferable to more complicated systems. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a common chelating ligand that is widely used in industry. EDTA, however, is not degradable in present wastewater treatment processes. (S,S)-Ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS), an isomer of EDTA, is biodegradable and has recently received attention as an alternative metal chelating agent for this reason. Investigations reported here utilized reflectance FTIR spectroscopy for the analysis of metal complexation of EDTA and EDDS. The sampling techniques used were diffused reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Similar studies using transmission mode FTIR have been carried out, but the analysis by reflectance techniques described here improved band resolution, minimized matrix interferences, and expanded on the previous work by providing an in situ method for analysis of pH dependence and metal complexation. Structural characteristics of sodium EDTA and EDDS compounds were identified using the results presented here. Complexes of Pb(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) with EDTA and EDDS were identified by the frequencies of carboxyl group vibrational bands, the difference between asymmetric and symmetric carboxyl groups bands, the relative band intensities, and the band shifts as a result of changes in pH. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Their densities, viscosities, refractive indices, and electrical conductivities were measured and correlated with thermodynamic and empirical equations in the temperature range of (298.15 to 343.15) K under ambient conditions. The effects of substituent groups in phenolate anions on these physical properties were then discussed on the basis of structure. Furthermore, the thermal expansion coefficient was calculated from the experimental values of density, and the correlation between the viscosity and the molar conductivity was proposed by the Walden rule. These ILs are classified as "poor ionic liquids" and have a poor temperature dependency of the thermal expansion coefficient. (Figure Presented).},

Fe3O4 nanorods of 70 nm length, encapsulated with polyethyleneimine show a very high R2 relaxivity value of 608 mM(-1) s(-1). The enhanced MRI contrast of nanorods is attributed to their higher surface area and anisotropic morphology. The higher surface area induces a stronger magnetic field perturbation over a larger volume more effectively for the outer sphere protons. The shape anisotropy contribution is understood by calculating the local magnetic field of nanorods and spherical nanoparticles under an applied magnetic field (3 Tesla). As compared to spherical geometry, the induced magnetic field of a rod is stronger and hence the stronger magnetic field over a large volume leads to a higher R2 relaxivity of nanorods.},

abstract = {Metal-ligand interactions in the Ca(2+)-binding sites of pike parvalbumin (pI = 4.10) have been examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The region of the COO- antisymmetric stretch provides useful information on the types of coordination of the COO- groups to the metal ions in the Mg(2+)-, Mn(2+)-, and Ca(2+)-bound forms. In the spectrum of the Ca(2+)-bound form, two bands are observed at 1,582 and 1,553 cm-1, whereas, in the spectra of the Mg(2+)- and Mn(2+)-bound forms, bands are observed only in the region around 1,582 cm-1 and no band is found in the region around 1,553 cm-1. The 1,553-cm-1 band of the Ca(2+)-bound form reflects the bidentate coordination of the COO- groups of both Glu-62 in the CD site and Glu-101 in the EF site to the Ca2+ ions, which has been made clear by X-ray analysis as a feature of the Ca(2+)-bound form. Absence of such a band in the spectrum of the Mn(2+)-bound form is consistent with the X-ray structure of this form where both of the two COO- groups are unidentate. These unidentate COO- groups of Glu-62 and Glu-101 in the Mn(2+)-bound form seem to give rise to a band at 1,577-1,574 cm-1. The spectrum of the Mg(2+)-bound form is also consistent with the 'pseudo-bridging' coordination of the COO- group of Glu-101 reported in the X-ray structure of a form where the Mg2+ ion occupies only the EF site, and the same spectrum is further indicative of the 'pseudo-bridging' coordination of the COO- group of Glu-62.},

The ILs plasticize the poly(ethylene oxide)-based polymer to increase its gas permeability. Compared to the base polymer, with a CO2 permeability of 145 barrer and a CO2 against nitrogen (N2) selectivity of 47, the highest CO2 permeability achieved was 530 barrer coupled with a CO2/N2 selectivity of 31 by having 60 vol % [1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium][Tf2N]. The extent of gas permeability improvement depends on the cation's terminal substituent. Substituents that promote additional noncovalent intermolecular interactions, such as hydroxyl, benzyl, and nitrile, can reduce the gas diffusivity by reducing the polymer chain mobility.

abstract = {In the current work, free volume concepts, primarily applied to glass formers in the literature, were transferred to ionic liquids (ILs). A series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C 4 MIM] +) based ILs was investigated by Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). The phase transition and dynamic properties of the ILs [C 4 MIM][X] with [X] {\`{A}} = [Cl] {\`{A}} , [BF 4 ] {\`{A}} , [PF 6 ] {\`{A}} , [OTf] {\`{A}} , [NTf 2 ] {\`{A}} and [B(hfip) 4 ] {\`{A}} were reported recently (Yu et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 6856–6868). In this subsequent work, attention was paid to the connection of the free volume from PALS (here the mean hole volume, hv h i) with the molecular structure, represented by volumes derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. These were the scaled molecular volume V m,scaled and the van der Waals volume V vdw . Linear correlations of hv h i at the ''knee'' temperature (hv h i(T k)) with V m,scaled and V vdw gave good results for the [C 4 MIM] + series. Further relationships between volumes from XRD data with the occupied volume V occ determined from PALS/PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) measurements and from Sanchez–Lacombe Equation of State (SL-EOS) fits were elaborated (V occ (SL-EOS) E 1.63 V vdw , R 2 = 0.981 and V occ (SL-EOS) E 1.12 V m,scaled , R 2 = 0.980). Finally, the usability of V m,scaled was justified in terms of the Cohen–Turnbull (CT) free volume theory. Empirical CT type plots of viscosity and electrical conductivity showed a systematic increase in the critical free volume with molecular size. Such correlations allow descriptions of IL properties with the easily accessible quantity V m,scaled within the context of the free volume.. G.

abstract = {The properties of a novel complex between pyranine (a photoacid and an electron donor species) and methyl viologen (an efficient electron acceptor, MV+2) in aqueous and in micellar solutions were determined. On the basis of the electrostatic driven force for pyranine/methyl viologen (pyranine/MV2+) complexation, the distribution of the complexant species could be manipulated using ionic micellar aggregates. This distribution permits control over competitive photochemical and photophysical pathways and therefore allowed maximization of electron- and proton-transfer capabilities. Pyranine/MV2+ complexes (for the acid and conjugated base pyranine species) were characterized by UVVis and fluorescence titrations. Pyranine/MV2+ photoredox reactions were investigated by monitoring the transients (laser flash photolysis) due to the solvated electron, the reduced (PO-) and oxidized (PO+) forms of pyranine, and the semireduced methyl viologen (MV+). Ionic aqueous micelles (sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) and anionic reversed micelles (sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate) were used to disassemble the complex by attraction of one of its species by an oppositely charged micellar aggregate. Present findings demonstrate the formation of a complex and its manipulation, which may allow the development of a photocatalyst agent whose properties can be adjusted by the appropriate disposition of the complex partners in supramolecular aggregates.},

abstract = {Electrostatic interactions provide a primary connection between a protein's three-dimensional structure and its function. Infrared probes are useful because vibrational frequencies of certain chemical groups, such as nitriles, are linearly sensitive to local electrostatic field and can serve as a molecular electric field meter. IR spectroscopy has been used to study electrostatic changes or fluctuations in proteins, but measured peak frequencies have not been previously mapped to total electric fields, because of the absence of a field-frequency calibration and the complication of local chemical effects such as H-bonds. We report a solvatochromic model that provides a means to assess the H-bonding status of aromatic nitrile vibrational probes and calibrates their vibrational frequencies to electrostatic field. The analysis involves correlations between the nitrile's IR frequency and its 13C chemical shift, whose observation is facilitated by a robust method for introducing isotopes into aromatic nitriles. The method is tested on the model protein ribonuclease S (RNase S) containing a labeled p-CN-Phe near the active site. Comparison of the measurements in RNase S against solvatochromic data gives an estimate of the average total electrostatic field at this location. The value determined agrees quantitatively with molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting broader potential for the use of IR probes in the study of protein electrostatics.},

@article{Cornelius2015,
abstract = {The molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and other P2 ATPases like Ca<sup>2 +</sup>-ATPase is influenced by the lipid environment via both general (physical) and specific (chemical) interactions. Whereas the general effects of bilayer structure on membrane protein function are fairly well described and understood, the importance of the specific interactions has only been realized within the last decade due particularly to the growing field of membrane protein crystallization, which has shed new light on the molecular details of specific lipid-protein interactions. It is a remarkable observation that specific lipid-protein interactions seem to be evolutionarily conserved, and conformations of specifically bound lipids at the lipid-protein surface within the membrane are similar in crystal structures determined with different techniques and sources of the protein, despite the rather weak lipid-protein interaction energy. Studies of purified detergent-soluble recombinant $\alpha$$\beta$ or $\alpha$$\beta$FXYD Na,K-ATPase complexes reveal three separate functional effects of phospholipids and cholesterol with characteristic structural selectivity. The observations suggest that these three effects are exerted at separate binding sites for phophatidylserine/cholesterol (stabilizing), polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (stimulatory), and saturated PC or sphingomyelin/cholesterol (inhibitory), which may be located within three lipid-binding pockets identified in recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase. The findings point to a central role of direct and specific interactions of different phospholipids and cholesterol in determining both stability and molecular activity of Na,K-ATPase and possible implications for physiological regulation by membrane lipid composition. This article is part of a special issue titled "Lipid-Protein Interactions."},

In this work, we present a comparison between methods of estimating hydrogen bond energies that are based on several electron density descriptors based on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, the natural bond orbital theory, and Mulliken population analysis. The results indicate that the most powerful approach is based on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, followed by the one employing the natural bond orbital theory. The Mulliken population analysis performed very poorly. The effect of including dispersion correction was also studied. Parameters for predicting hydrogen bond energies are presented.},

We present ultrafast spectroscopic measurements of vibrational relaxation in the ion-coordinating carboxylate groups of EDTA, which we use as a model of carboxylate-mediated ion binding, as EDTA binds a series of divalent and trivalent metal ions with high affinity. The measurements are interpreted using a Redfield-based anharmonic model of vibrational relaxation that rationalizes trends in vibrational lifetimes in terms of vibrational energy transfer between EDTA's asymmetric carboxylate stretching vibrational modes and lower-lying modes. Results show ion-dependent changes in complex structure and dynamics well outside the temporal and spatial resolution of common structural methods and demonstrate how vibrational relaxation measurements may contribute to exploration of ion-binding dynamics on ultrashort length and time scales.},

abstract = {Here we perform a comprehensive study of ultrafast molecular and vibrational dynamics of water confined in small reversed micelles (RMs). The molecular picture is elucidated with two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy of water OH stretch vibrations and molecular dynamics simulations, bridged by theoretical calculations of linear and 2D IR vibrational spectra. To investigate the effects of intermolecular coupling, experiments and modeling are performed for isotopically diluted (HDO in D2O) and undiluted (H2O) water. We put a separation of water inside RMs into two subensembles (water-bound and surfactant-bound molecules), observed by many before, on a solid theoretical basis. Water molecules fully attached to the lipid interface ("shell" water) are decoupled from one another and from the central water nanopool ("core" water). The environmental fluctuations are largely "frozen" for the shell water, while the core waters demonstrate much faster dynamics but still not as fast as in the bulk case. A substantial nanoconfinement effect on the dynamics of the core water is observed after disentanglement of the shell water contribution, which is fully confirmed by the simulations of 2D IR spectra. Current results provide new insights into interaction between biological objects like membranes or proteins with the surrounding aqueous bath, and highlight peculiarities in vibrational energy redistribution near the lipid surface.},

abstract = {Water interactions in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([emim][CH(3)COO]) were studied utilizing classical and ab initio simulation methods. The self-diffusivities for water and the ionic liquid (IL) were studied experimentally using pulse field gradient NMR spectroscopy and correlated with computational results. Water forms hydrogen bonding networks with the ionic liquid, and depending on the concentration of water, there are profound effects on the self-diffusivities of the various species. Both simulation and experiments show that the self-diffusivities for species in the water-[emim][CH(3)COO] system exhibit minima at 40-50 mol% water. Water interaction with the [CH(3)COO](-) anion predominates over the water-water and water-cation interactions at most water concentrations. Simulations further indicate that decreasing water-[CH(3)COO](-) interaction will increase the IL and water self-diffusivities. Self-diffusivities in the water-IL systems are dependent upon the cation in a complex way. Water interactions with [P(4444)][CH(3)COO] are reduced compared to [emim][CH(3)COO]. The [P(4444)](+) cation is bulkier than the [emim](+) cation and has a smaller self-diffusivity, but when water was introduced to [P(4444)] [CH(3)COO], the water-[CH(3)COO](-) hydrogen bonding network in the [P(4444)][CH(3)COO] was much smaller than the one observed in [emim][CH(3)COO].},

Spectra of the C-H stretching modes have been deconvoluted using our previous computer program of the Voigt-lineshape function. Frequency shifts, Lorentzian spectral widths, and band absorbance were examined as a function of temperature. In order to interpret the observed behaviors, we have developed a simple mechanical model as well as a chemical equilibrium model. The model analyses suggest that enthalpy changes for the cluster and/or ion-pair breaking reactions in the liquid state are several kJ mol(-1) endothermic, and the degree of dissociations of ion pairs or hydrogen bonded clusters is in the range from 0.3 to 0.9 with different magnitudes for the five ionic liquids.},

These CMP materials incorporate a range of chemical functionalities including carboxylic acids, amines, hydroxyl groups, and methyl groups. The carboxylic acid functionalised network, rather than its amine analogue, shows the highest isosteric heat of sorption for CO2. This supports recent computational predictions for metal–organic frameworks and suggests that acid- functionalised frameworks could outperform more widely studied amine sorbents in CO2 capture and separation application.},

abstract = {Examination of nature's favorite molecules reveals a striking preference for making carbon-heteroatom bonds over carbon-carbon bonds-surely no surprise given that carbon dioxide is nature's starting material and that most reactions are performed in water. Nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides are condensation polymers of small subunits stitched together by carbon-heteroatom bonds. Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call "click chemistry". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect "spring-loaded" reactions. The stringent criteria for a process to earn click chemistry status are described along with examples of the molecular frameworks that are easily made using this spartan, but powerful, synthetic strategy.},

abstract = {The backbone motions of calcium-free Xenopus calmodulin have been characterized by measurements of the 15N longitudinal relaxation times (T1) at 51 and 61 MHz, and by conducting transverse relaxation (T2), spin-locked transverse relaxation (T1 rho), and 15N-[1H] heteronuclear NOE measurements at 61 MHz 15N frequency. Although backbone amide hydrogen exchange experiments indicate that the N-terminal domain is more stable than calmodulin's C-terminal half, slowly exchanging backbone amide protons are found in all eight alpha-helices and in three of the four short beta-strands. This confirms that the calcium-free form consists of stable secondary structure and does not adopt a 'molten globule' type of structure. However, the C-terminal domain of calmodulin is subject to conformational exchange on a time scale of about 350 microseconds, which affects many of the C-terminal domain residues. This results in significant shortening of the 15N T2 values relative to T1 rho, whereas the T1 rho and T2 values are of similar magnitude in the N-terminal half of the protein. A model in which the motion of the protein is assumed to be isotropic suggests a rotational correlation time for the protein of about 8 ns but quantitatively does not agree with the magnetic field dependence of the T1 values and does not explain the different T2 values found for different alpha-helices in the N-terminal domain. These latter parameters are compatible with a flexible dumb-bell model in which each of calmodulin's two domains freely diffuse in a cone with a semi-angle of about 30 degrees and a time constant of about 3 ns, whereas the overall rotation of the protein occurs on a much slower time scale of about 12 ns. The difference in the transverse relaxation rates observed between the amides in helices C and D suggests that the change in interhelical angle upon calcium binding is less than predicted by Herzberg et al.

Recent examples are described illustrating the application of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to calcium signaling proteins with an emphasis on the new information available in single-molecule fluorescence burst measurements, resonance energy transfer, and polarization modulation methods. Calcium signaling pathways are crucial in many cellular processes. The calcium binding protein calmodulin (CaM) serves as a molecular switch to regulate a network of calcium signaling pathways. Single-molecule spectroscopic methods can yield insights into conformations and dynamics of CaM and CaM-regulated proteins. Examples include studies of the conformations and dynamics of CaM, binding of target peptides, and interaction with the plasma-membrane Ca2+ pump. Single-molecule resonance energy transfer measurements revealed conformational substates of CaM, and single-molecule polarization modulation spectroscopy was used to probe interactions between CaM and the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase.},

Unlike an absorptionspectrum, the VSF signal can be considered as a sum of signed contributions from different hydrogen-bonded species in the sample. We show that the recently observed positive feature at low frequency, in the imaginary part of the signal, is a result of cancellation between the positive contributions from four-hydrogen-bonded molecules and negative contributions from those molecules with one or two broken hydrogen bonds.Spectral densities for each of these subgroups span the entire relevant spectral range. Three-body interactions within our newly developed E3B water simulation model prove to be critical in describing the proper balance between different hydrogen-bonded species, as (two-body) SPC/E, TIP4P, and TIP4P/2005 models fail to reproduce the positive feature. The results clarify the molecular origin of the VSF signal, and highlight the importance of many-body interactions for water in heterogeneous situations.},

Detailed analysis of the spectra shows that the dominant low frequency process centred at ca. 0.06 to 10 GHz (depending on the salt and the temperature) is better described using a symmetrically broadened Cole-Cole model rather than the asymmetric Cole-Davidson models used previously. Evaluation of the temperature dependence of the static permittivities, effective dipole moments, volumes of rotation, activation energies, and relaxation times derived from the dielectric data indicates that the low frequency process cannot be solely due to rotational diffusion of the dipolar imidazolium cations, as has been thought, but must also include other contributions, probably from cooperative motions. Analysis of the Debye process observed at higher frequencies for these RTILs is not undertaken because it overlaps with even faster processes that lie outside the range of the present instrumentation.},

abstract = {Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of neat methanol at ambient temperature is studied with a three-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy technique. The first two dimensions are represented by a time series of incoherent anti-Stokes Raman spectra at a given mid-IR pump frequency. The third dimension involves changing the mid-IR pump frequency within the manifold of CH and OH stretching transitions ?(CH) and ?(OH). Each 2D representation shows the VER dynamics occurring as a result of pumping a specific vibrational transition. The decay of the pumped transition into first-generation daughters, and the subsequent decay into second-, and even third-generation daughters can be monitored. The third dimension shows how VER depends on the nature of the pumped transition. Additional information about the buildup of excitation in the bath of lower-energy collective excitations (phonons) is obtained by monitoring the heating of CCl4 spectators in methanol?CCl4 mixtures. Three distinct stages are seen in VER of ?(CH). The pumped ?(CH) creates two quanta of bending vibrations $\delta$(CH) or $\delta$(OH) (0?1 ps), the $\delta$(CH) vibrations preferentially create CO stretch ?(CO), and the $\delta$(OH) create methyl rock ?(CH3) (2?5 ps), and then ?(CH3) and ?(CO) decay into phonons (5?15 ps). Three stages are also seen in ?(OH) VER except that the first stage involves exciting every other vibration to some extent. About 10% of ?(OH) decay occurs in four stages, where the first stage is ?(OH) ? ?(CH). The IR?Raman 3D technique is compared to other multidimensional vibrational spectroscopies. This 3D method is presently the most powerful technique for studying VER in condensed phases. It is sensitive to overtone and combination transitions buried under more intense fundamental absorption spectra. In addition it is sensitive to very weak cascaded anharmonic couplings responsible for the excitation of successive generations of daughter vibrations.},

All possible combinations of the three mutations were produced. The single mutants D5S and D9E and the double mutant D5S/D9E have low affinity for Ca2+. All the mutants containing mutation D12E are Ca2+-specific and have higher affinities than wild type, even when containing mutations D5S or D9E. All of the mutants studied have lower affinity for Mg2+ than the wild-type protein. As expected, the changes in binding free energy that each mutant produces depend on the residues present at the other positions of the site, since the mutated positions are very close in the protein structure. Coupling energies are about the same for all pairs of mutants when binding Ca2+, but can have different values when binding Mg2+. D5S and D9E have a large negative coupling energy for Mg2+ binding which suggests an interaction between these two positions. When mutation D12E is present, the coupling energy for Mg2+ binding between D5S and D9E is much lower, suggesting that this interaction occurs only if an aspartate is in position 12. Glutamate in position 9 may be able to coordinate Mg2+ directly in the double mutant D5S/D9E.},

The rotational and local structural fluctuation dynamics of CO2 in the room temperature ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EmimNTf2) were investigated by using ultrafast infrared spectroscopy to interrogate the CO2 asymmetric stretch. Polarization-selective pump probe measurements yielded the orientational correlation function of the CO2 vibrational transition dipole. It was found that reorientation of the carbon dioxide occurs on 3 time scales: 0.91 ± 0.03, 8.3 ± 0.1, 54 ± 1 ps. The initial two are attributed to restricted wobbling motions originating from a gating of CO2 motions by the IL cations and anions. The final (slowest) decay corresponds to complete orientational randomization. Two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo (2D IR) spectroscopy provided information on structural rearrangements, which cause spectral diffusion, through the time dependence of the 2D line shape. Analysis of the time-dependent 2D IR spectra yields the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF). Polarization-selective 2D IR experiments conducted on the CO2 asymmetric stretch in the parallel- and perpendicular-pumped geometries yield significantly different FFCFs due to a phenomenon known as reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD), revealing strong vector interactions with the liquid structures that evolve slowly on the (independently measured) rotation time scales. To separate the RISD contribution to the FFCF from the structural spectral diffusion contribution, the previously developed first order Stark effect RISD model is reformulated to describe the second order (quadratic) Stark effect—the first order Stark effect vanishes because CO2 does not have a permanent dipole moment. Through this analysis, we characterize the structural fluctuations of CO2 in the ionic liquid solvation environment, which separate into magnitude-only and combined magnitude and directional correlations of the liquid's time dependent electric field. This new methodology will enable highly incisive comparisons between CO2 dynamics in a variety of ionic liquid systems.},

@article{Cavanagh2008,
abstract = {Although electron transfer reactions are among the most fundamental in chemistry, it is still not clear how to isolate the roles of the solute and solvent in moving charge between reactants in solution. In this paper, we address this question by comparing the ultrafast charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) dynamics of potasside (K(-)) in diethyl ether (DEE) to those of sodide (Na(-)) in both DEE and tetrahydrofuran (THF). We find that for sodide in both DEE and THF, CTTS excitation leads to delayed ejection of a solvated electron that appears with its equilibrium absorption spectrum. This indicates that the ejected electrons are localized in pre-existing solvent traps, suggesting that the structure of liquid DEE is characterized by cavities that are favorably polarized to localize an excess electron, as has been previously shown is the case for liquid THF. We also find that the geminate recombination dynamics following CTTS excitation of sodide in THF and DEE are similar, suggesting that the nature of the CTTS excited states and their coupling to the electronic states supported by the naturally occurring solvent cavities are similar in the two solvents. In contrast, the geminate recombination dynamics of potasside and sodide in DEE are different, with red-edge excitation of the K(-) CTTS band producing a greater number of long-lived electrons than is seen following the corresponding red-edge excitation of the Na(-) CTTS band. This indicates that the CTTS excited states of K(-) are better able to couple to the electronic states supported by the naturally occurring solvent cavities, allowing us to compare the energetic positions of the potasside and sodide ground and CTTS excited states on a common absolute scale. Finally, we also observe a strong transient absorption following the CTTS excitation of potasside in DEE that correlates well with the 766 nm position of the gas-phase potassium D-line. The data indicate that CTTS excitation of alkali metal anions essentially instantaneously produces a gas-phase-like neutral alkali metal atom, which then spontaneously undergoes partial ejection of the remaining valence electron to form a neutral alkali metal cation:solvated electron tight-contact pair.},

Ion-ion radial distribution functions both calculated from MD and derived from the empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) model to the experimental data show the alternating shell structure of anions around the cation, as anticipated. Spatial probability distributions reveal the main anion-to-cation features as in-plane interactions of anions with the three imidazolium ring hydrogens and cation-cation planar stacking above/below the imidazolium rings. Interestingly, the presence of the polarized hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) anion (acetate) leads to an increase in anion-anion tail-tail structuring within each anion shell, an indicator of the onset of hydrophobic regions within the anion regions of the liquid. MD simulations show the importance of scaling of the effective ionic charges in the basic simulation approach to accurately reproduce both the observed experimental neutron scattering cross sections and ion self-diffusion coefficients.},

Here, the effect of polymer cross-link density on the ionic liquid stability, on the mechanical properties of the resulting films, and on the gas separation properties were studied. Cross-link density was modified by changing the chain length of ethoxylated diacrylate and triacrylate monomers, and by incorporating small amounts of short, multifunctional acrylate monomers. Without the ionic liquid acting as permanent plasticizer, higher cross-link density is associated with higher yield strength but lower strain at break, as expected. In a plasticized network, however, the loss in flexibility is not accompanied by higher yield strength, leaving ion gels made from highly cross-linked network more fragile than those having longer, more flexible chains. Lowering cross-link density also allowed more ionic liquids to be incorporated as a phase stable gel and led to better CO2 separation performance.},

abstract = {The low-frequency part of the vibrational spectrum of a liquid is dominated by intermolecular degrees of freedom. Hence, it reports on the motion of solvent molecules with respect to each other rather than on the intramolecular details of individual molecules. In hydrogen-bonded liquids, in particular water, a detailed understanding of the low-frequency spectrum is enormously complicated because of the complex hydrogen-bond network, which constantly rearranges on an ultrafast femtosecond to picosecond time scale. Many of the peculiar properties of water have their origin in these processes. Conventional far-infrared (far-IR) or Raman spectroscopy, as well as two-dimensional IR (2D-IR) spectroscopy, are all linear with respect to the intermolecular (solvent) degrees of freedom. These spectroscopies tell us much about the density of states in the low-frequency range but little about the dynamics of the hydrogen-bond making and breaking. In this Account, we propose three-dimensional IR (3D-IR) spectroscopy as a novel tool that is nonlinear with respect to these low-frequency degrees of freedom; hence, it may provide much more detailed insights into intermolecular dynamics. The first experimental realizations of 3D-IR spectroscopy have been demonstrated in the literature; the information it affords is similar to that of 2D-Raman spectroscopy. Three-dimensional IR spectroscopy will, for the first time, reveal whether the low-frequency part of the vibrational spectrum of liquids has to be considered mostly homogeneously or inhomogeneously broadened. Alternately, we may find that either of these classifications is completely wrong because the normal mode picture fails when thermal energy is of the same order of magnitude as the ruggedness of the intramolecular potential energy surface. We briefly introduce the theoretical background of 3D-IR spectroscopy and discuss two of its most promising applications: (a) the more thorough characterization of non-Gaussian stochastic processes such as the hydrogen-bond dynamics of water and (b) non-Markovian ultrafast exchange processes. In the ultrafast regime, many of the otherwise valid simplifying assumptions of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics (for example, linear response and Markovian dynamics) are likely to fail; 3D-IR spectroscopy will allow us for the first time to experimentally explore their range of validity.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to investigate nanostructural organization in mixtures of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ionic liquid and water at multiple water concentrations. Evolution of the polar network, water network, and micelle structures is visualized and analyzed via partial radial distribution functions. The calculated static partial structure factors show that within the range of water contents examined, polar networks, water networks, and micelles possess an approximately invariant characteristic length at around 20 A. Furthermore, the above calculations point out that, as the amount of water increases, the polar network is continuously broken up (screened) by the intruding water, while the structural organization of the water network and the micelle exhibits a turnover. At the turnover point, the most ordered micelle (cation-cation) structure and water (water-anion-water) network are formed. Thereafter, the structural organization abates drastically, and only loose micelle structure exists due to the dominant water-water interactions. The simulated turnover of structural organization agrees with the sharpest peak in the experimentally obtained structure factor in aqueous solutions of similar ionic liquids; the simulated water structure reveals that water can form liquidlike associated aggregates due to the planar symmetry and strong basicity of NO(3)-, in agreement with experiment. The turnover of structural organization of micelles results from the persistent competition between the hydrophobic interactions of the nonpolar groups and the breakup of the charged polar network with increasing water content, whereas the turnover of the water network results from the competition between the water-water and water-anion interactions.},

abstract = {Cloud point phenomena were observed for polyoxyethylene (POE)-type nonionic surfactants in ionic liquid mixtures composed of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (emimBF(4)) and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (hmimBF(4)). The cloud point temperature vs. concentration curve (cloud point curve) shifts toward higher temperatures with an increase in POE chain length and with a decrease in hydrocarbon chain length of the surfactants, reflecting the fact that POE chains and hydrocarbon chains act as a solvophilic group and a solvophobic group, respectively. The analysis of (1)H NMR chemical shifts revealed that hmimBF(4) interacts with the surfactant preferentially in the ionic liquid mixture. Two liquid phases, one being surfactant rich and the other ionic liquid rich, coexist in equilibrium above the cloud point curve. In accordance with the preferential interaction of hmimBF(4) with the surfactant, hmimBF(4) is more concentrated in the surfactant-rich phase, while emimBF(4) is more concentrated in the ionic liquid-rich phase compared with the composition of the original ionic liquid mixture. The temperature dependence of (1)H NMR chemical shifts suggests that the desolvation of hmim cation from the POE chains proceeds with an increase in temperature. In other words, the solvophilicity of the surfactant POE chain is reduced with temperature, which would be responsible for the liquid-liquid phase separation occurring at elevated temperature. The present results suggest that the property of ionic liquid as a solvent to support the self-assembly of amphiphilic compounds can be tuned by mixing two ionic liquid species, since the present surfactants show no cloud point in hmimBF(4) solution and are immiscible with emimBF(4).},

abstract = {Water is an integral part of the homotetrameric M2 proton channel of the influenza A virus, which not only assists proton conduction but could also play an important role in stabilizing channel-blocking drugs. Herein, we employ two dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and site-specific IR probes, i.e., the amide I bands arising from isotopically labeled Ala30 and Gly34 residues, to probe how binding of either rimantadine or 7,7-spiran amine affects the water dynamics inside the M2 channel. Our results show, at neutral pH where the channel is non-conducting, that drug binding leads to a significant increase in the mobility of the channel water. A similar trend is also observed at pH 5.0 although the difference becomes smaller. Taken together, these results indicate that the channel water facilitates drug binding by increasing its entropy. Furthermore, the 2D IR spectral signatures obtained for both probes under different conditions collectively support a binding mechanism whereby amantadine-like drugs dock in the channel with their ammonium moiety pointing toward the histidine residues and interacting with a nearby water cluster, as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. We believe these findings have important implications for designing new anti-influenza drugs.},

abstract = {We present two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of the OD stretch vibration of isotope diluted water (HOD/H(2)O) from ambient conditions (293 K) down to the metastable supercooled regime (260 K). We observe that spectral diffusion slows down from 700 fs to 2.6 ps as we lower the temperature. A comparison between measurements performed at the magic angle with those at parallel polarization shows that the 2D IR line shape is affected by the frequency-dependent anisotropy decay in the case of parallel polarization, altering the extracted correlation decay. A fit within the framework of an Arrhenius law reveals an activation energy of E(a) = 6.2 ± 0.2 kcal/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 1/A = 0.02 ± 0.01 fs. Alternatively, a power law fit results in an exponent $\gamma$ = 2.2 and a singularity temperature T(s) = 221 K. We tentatively conclude that the power law provides the better physical picture to describe the dynamics of liquid water around the freezing point.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the slow dynamics of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, a very popular room-temperature ionic solvent. Our study predicts the existence of heterogeneity in the liquid and shows that this heterogeneity is the underlying microscopic cause for the recently reported "red-edge effect" (REE) observed in the study of fluorescence of the organic probe 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene. This theoretical work explains in microscopic terms the relation between REE and dynamic heterogeneity in a room-temperature ionic liquid (IL). The REE is typical of micellar or colloidal systems, which are characterized by microscopic environments that are structurally very different. In contrast, in the case of this room-temperature IL, the REE occurs because of the long period during which molecules are trapped in quasistatic local solvent cages. This trapping time, which is longer than the lifetime of the excited-state probe, together with the inability of the surroundings to adiabatically relax, induces a set of site-specific spectroscopic responses. Subensembles of fluorescent molecules associated with particular local environments absorb and emit at different frequencies. We describe in detail the absorption wavelength-dependent emission spectra of 2-amino-7-nitrofluorene and show that this dependence on lambda(ex) is characteristic of the IL and, as is to be expected, is absent in the case of a normal solvent such as methanol.},

abstract = {Cation-specific ion pairing dynamics between M + (M = Ag or Cu) and SCN - in N,N-dimethylthioformamide (DMTF) are studied by probing the nitrile (CN) stretching vibration. The SCN - ion, which is an ambidentate ligand, readily associates with cations to form two different types of contact ion pairs (CIPs) (i.e., M-SCN or M-NCS) and its CN stretching frequency is significantly blue-shifted so that free SCN - and CIPs can be well-distinguished in the FTIR spectra. Interestingly, Ag + ions prefer the formation of Ag-SCN in DMTF (Ag + + SCN - Ag-SCN) but Cu + ions form Cu-NCS (Cu + + SCN - Cu-NCS). We have studied the effect of ion-ligand binding on the ion pairing equilibria and dynamics in great detail by using FTIR, IR pump-probe (IR PP), and two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. First, our quantum chemical calculations corroborate that Ag-SCN and Cu-NCS of the two possible CIP configurations (M-SCN or M-NCS) are energetically stable and favored in DMTF. Second, the thermodynamic properties ($\Delta$H and $\Delta$S) of ion pairing equilibria are determined by temperature-dependent FTIR experiments. Finally, IR PP and 2DIR experiments are used to measure the association and dissociation rate constants. The ion pairing dynamics between Cu + and SCN - are found to occur on much faster timescales than those between Ag + and SCN - . Our current results provide important insights into understanding the effect of ion-ligand binding on the ion pairing equilibria and dynamics in polar solvents.},

abstract = {In this paper, the characterization of a protic ionic liquid, diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([dema][TfO]), as a proton conductor for a fuel cell and the fabrication of a membrane-type fuel cell system using [dema][TfO] under nonhumidified conditions at intermediate temperatures are described in detail. In terms of physicochemical and electrochemical properties, [dema][TfO] exhibits high activity for fuel cell electrode reactions (i.e., the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)) at a Pt electrode, and the open circuit voltage (OCV) of a liquid fuel cell is 1.03 V at 150 degrees C, as has reported in ref 27. However, diethylmethylammonium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amide ([dema][NTf(2)]) has relatively low HOR and ORR activity, and thus, the OCV is ca. 0.7 V, although [dema][NTf(2)] and [dema][TfO] have an identical cation ([dema]) and similar thermal and bulk-transport properties. Proton conduction occurs mainly via the vehicle mechanism in [dema][TfO] and the proton transference number (t(+)) is 0.5-0.6. This relatively low t(+) appears to be more disadvantageous for a proton conductor than for other electrolytes such as hydrated sulfonated polymer electrolyte membranes (t(+) = 1.0). However, fast proton-exchange reactions occur between ammonium cations and amines in a model compound. This indicates that the proton-exchange mechanism contributes to the fuel cell system under operation, where deprotonated amines are continuously generated by the cathodic reaction, and that polarization of the cell is avoided. Six-membered sulfonated polyimides in the diethylmethylammonium form exhibit excellent compatibility with [dema][TfO]. The composite membranes can be obtained up to a [dema][TfO] content of 80 wt % and exhibit good thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and mechanical strength and gas permeation comparable to those of hydrated Nafion. H(2)/O(2) fuel cells prepared using the composite membranes can successfully operate at temperatures from 30 to 140 degrees C under nonhumidified conditions, and a current density of 250 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 120 degrees C. The protic ionic liquid and its composite membrane are a possible candidate for an electrolyte of a H(2)/O(2) fuel cell that operates under nonhumidified conditions.},

Accounting for this effect is of crucial importance for a correct description of all solution properties. We calculate the temperature and concentration dependence of the average fraction of hydrogen bonds between PEO and water and find very good agreement between our predictions and experimental or MD simulation data. We also make predictions concerning the temperature behavior of the second virial coefficient A2 and the effective interaction parameter ?eff and compare it with experimental data. We found that the decrease of A2 with temperature is caused by the delicate balance of the opposing effects of water-PEO and water-water hydrogen bonding. The phase diagram for PEO of different molecular weights in water is calculated using experimentally reported data for the energy and entropy of association. We achieved very good quantitative agreement with most of the experimental data reported, in particular reproducing the closed loop regions of phase coexistence. We also compare our findings with results of other theoretical models.},

abstract = {The evaporation of water from hydrated alkaline earth metal ions, produced by electrospray ionization, was studied in a Fourier transform mass spectrometer. Zero-pressure-limit dissociation rate constants for loss of a single water molecule from the hydrated divalent metal ions, M(2+)(H(2)O)(n) (M = Mg, Ca, and Sr for n = 5-7, and M = Ba for n = 4-7), are measured as a function of temperature using blackbody infrared radiative dissociation. From these values, zero-pressure-limit Arrhenius parameters are obtained. By modeling the dissociation kinetics using a master equation formalism, threshold dissociation energies (E(o)) are determined. These reactions should have a negligible reverse activation barrier; therefore, E(o) values should be approximately equal to the binding energy or hydration enthalpy at 0 K. For the hepta- and hexahydrated ions at low temperature, binding energies follow the trend expected on the basis of ionic radii: Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba. For the hexahydrated ions at high temperature, binding energies follow the order Ca > Mg > Sr > Ba. The same order is observed for the pentahydrated ions. Collisional dissociation experiments on the tetrahydrated species result in relative dissociation rates that directly correlate with the size of the metals. These results indicate the presence of two isomers for hexahydrated magnesium ions: a low-temperature isomer in which the six water molecules are located in the first solvation shell, and a high-temperature isomer with the most likely structure corresponding to four water molecules in the inner shell and two water molecules in the second shell. These results also indicate that the pentahydrated magnesium ions have a structure with four water molecules in the first solvation shell and one in the outer shell. The dissociation kinetics for the hexa- and pentahydrated clusters of Ca(2+), Sr(2+), and Ba(2+) are consistent with structures in which all the water molecules are located in the first solvation shell.},

Detailed analysis shows a preference for nonpolar interactions between the cyclic ether molecules plus polar interactions between the ether and solvent water and hydrophobic hydration of the nonpolar regions of the solute. The increase in the number of hydrogen-bond-acceptor sites relative to the number of hydrogen-bond-donor sites in this system, compared to the balanced situation that would be found in pure water, has a marked compressive effect on the structure of the solvent. Despite the small size of the solvent water molecules, the 0.23 mole fraction aqueous solution is still found to contain small voids akin to those in pure liquid tetrahydrofuran. In contrast to the positive surface charge of the voids in the pure system, the average void in this aqueous solution is found to have a net negative charge. This is due to contributions from the water oxygen atoms that are negatively polarized by their intramolecular bonding.},

Coordination structures of Mg(2+) of NtCaM3 and NtCaM13 were similar but different from that of NtCaM1, while the Ca(2+) -binding manner was similar among the three CaMs. The amplitude differences of the band at 1554-1550 cm(-1) obtained by second-derivative spectra indicated that the intensity change of the band of NtCaM13 was smaller in response to [Ca(2+) ] increases under low [Ca(2+) ] conditions than were those of NtCaM1 and NtCaM3, while the intensity reached the same level under high [Ca(2+) ]. Therefore, NtCaM13 has a characteristic secondary structure and specific Mg(2+) -binding manner and needs higher [Ca(2+) ] for bidentate Ca(2+) coordination of 12th Glu in EF-hand motifs. The Ca(2+) -binding mechanisms of the EF-hand motifs of the three CaMs are similar; however, the cation-dependent conformational change in NtCaM13 is unique among the three NtCaMs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Hydrogen bond population dynamics are extricated with exceptional detail using ultrafast (<50 fs) infrared multidimensional stimulated vibrational echo correlation spectroscopy with full phase information and frequency resolved infrared pump-probe experiments performed on the hydroxyl stretch of methanol-OD oligomers in CCl4. Hydrogen bond breaking makes it possible to acquire data for times much greater than the hydroxyl stretch vibrational lifetime. The correlation spectra and detailed calculations demonstrate that vibrational relaxation leads to hydrogen bond breaking for oligomers that have hydroxyl stretch frequencies on the low energy (red) side of the hydroxyl stretch spectrum, the spectral region that is associated with the strongest hydrogen bonds. Frequency resolved pump-probe data support the conclusions drawn from the correlation spectra. Using a global fit to the pump-probe spectra, in conjunction with assignments made possible through the correlation spectra, it is demonstrated that the residual ground state and photoproduct of hydrogen bond breaking are prepared near their thermal equilibrium distribution. The spectrum of the hydrogen bond breaking photoproduct and the residual ground state approach the steady-state temperature difference spectrum on the tens of picoseconds time scale, indicating the system thermalizes on this time scale.

abstract = {The vibrational relaxation dynamics of pseudo-halide anions XCN- (X = O, S, Se) in polar solvents were studied to understand the effect of charge on solute-to-solvent intermolecular energy transfer (IET) and solvent assisted intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR) pathways. The T1 relaxation times of the CN stretch in these anions were measured by IR pump/IR probe spectroscopy, in which the 0-1 transition was excited, and the 0-1 and 1-2 transitions were monitored to follow the recovery of the ground state and decay of the excited state. For these anions in five solvents, H2O, D2O, CH3OH, CH3CN, and (CH3)2SO, relaxation rates followed the trend of OCN- > SCN- > SeCN-. For these anions and isotopes of SCN-, the relaxation rate was a factor of a few (2.5-10) higher in H2O than in D2O. To further probe the solvent isotope effect, the relaxation rates of S12C14N-, S13C14N-, and S12C15N- in deuterated methanols (CH3OH, CH3OD, CH3OH, CD3OD) were compared. Relaxation rate was found to be affected by the change of solvent vibrational band at the CN- stretching mode (CD3 symmetric stretch) and lower frequency regions, suggesting the presence of both direct IET and solvent assisted IVR relaxation pathways. The possible relaxation pathways and mechanisms for the observed trends in solute and solvent dependence were discussed.},

abstract = {Conformational energies of meso and racemic dyads of poly(methyl acrylate) have been computed as functions of skeletal bond rotations, the planar ester group being oriented perpendicular to the plane defined by the two adjoining skeletal bonds. Solvent interactions affect the relative energies of various conformations, as found for polystyrene. The conformational energy surfaces are similar to those for polystyrene, and the same two-state scheme with trans and gauche states at $\phi$t = 10° and $\phi$g= 110° is applied. The first-order statistical weight parameter is given by $\eta$ = 1.0(±0.1) exp(-E$\eta$/RT) where the preexponential factor is evaluated from the computed conformational energy surfaces. Similarly, the second-order parameters that represent CH2-CH2, CH2-R, and R-R interactions, respectively, are $\omega$ = 1.3(±0.1) exp(-1600/RT), $\omega$′ = 1.4(±0.1) exp(-1600/RT), and $\omega$″ = 1.2(±0.1) exp(-E$\omega$″/RT). The energies E$\eta$ and E$\omega$″, being affected by solvent interactions, cannot be reliably estimated from energy calculations. Agreement with experimental dimensions of the PMA chain and stereochemical equilibria in the dimeric and trimeric oligomers requires that E$\eta$ = -300 ± 100 cal mol-1 and E$\omega$″ = 1500 ± 300 cal mol-1. Calculated values of the NMR-coupling parameter $\Delta$J for oligomers and for isotactic PMA are consistent with experimental results. {\textcopyright} 1975, American Chemical Society.

It is found that although the homogeneous lineshape approximation yields satisfactory FTIR spectra, 2DIR spectra are sensitive to the inhomogeneity naturally present in any solvated protein and the common approximations of a static structure and averaged-effect solvent are invalid. By building on the local amide Hamiltonian and incorporating site energy variation with electrostatic-based models and disorder from MD trajectories, good agreement is obtained between calculated and measured 2DIR spectra. The largest contribution to the observed inhomogeneity is found to be the fluctuating site energies, which in turn are most sensitive to the water solvent. With the ability to accurately predict 2DIR spectra from atomistic simulations, new opportunities to test force fields and mechanistic predictions from MD are revealed.},

Recent publications have attempted to determine the polarity of RTILs using empirical solvent polarity scales. The results have indicated that most RTILs have similar polarities. Nevertheless, RTILs are capable of behaving quite differently when used as solvents in organic synthesis, matrixes in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, liquid−liquid extraction, and as stationary phases in gas chromatography. The work presented in this study uses a linear free energy approach to characterize 17 RTILs on the basis of their distinct multiple solvation interactions with probe solute molecules. This model provides data that can be used to help identify the interactions and properties that are important for specific chemical applications.},

Each experiment measures a spectrum with features that reflect vibrational couplings between amide I transitions of the protein backbone and is therefore more sensitive to protein conformation than traditional FTIR spectroscopy. As the temperature is raised, 2D IR spectra show the disappearance of cross peaks between two vibrational transitions arising from antiparallel $\beta$-sheet structure as well as the blue shift to a diagonally elongated inhomogeneous spectrum. DVE and DPP spectra can be related to projections of the complex 2D IR correlation spectrum and also show clear signatures of $\beta$-sheet structure in the native state. Singular value decomposition of the nonlinear spectra reveal a pretransition at 47 °C that precedes the melting of $\beta$ sheets in the primary denaturing transition at 65 °C. Residual secondary structure is observed in the thermally denatured state. These experiments suggest that nonlinear infrared spectroscopy is an effective probe of protein conformation that can be used to probe the equilibrium thermodynamics and nonequilibrium kinetics and dynamics of protein folding.},

The resulting spectra were fit using superpositions of simulated spectra generated from the MXQET simulation program, based on a model incorporating nearest-neighbor jumps from positions on the vertices of a truncated icosahedron (soccer-ball shape). The lower molecular-mass samples, influenced by the presence of more chain ends, showed more heterogeneity (broader distribution) and lower glass transitions than the higher molecular-mass samples. The MDSC experiments on both protonated and deuterated samples showed behavior consistent with the NMR results, but temperature shifted due to the different frequency range of the measurements in terms of both the position and breadth of the glass transition as a function of molecular mass.},

abstract = {The fifth order contributions to the signals of ultrafast infrared spectrally resolved stimulated vibrational echoes at high intensities have been investigated in carbonmonoxy heme proteins. High intensities are often required to obtain good data. Intensity dependent measurements are presented on hemoglobin-CO (Hb–CO) and a mutant of myoglobin, H64V–CO. The spectrally resolved vibrational echoes demonstrate that fifth order effects arise at both the 1-0 and the 2-1 emission frequencies of the stretching mode of the CO chromophore bound at the active site of heme proteins. Unlike one-dimensional experiments, in which the signal is integrated over all emission frequencies, spectrally resolving the signal shows that the fifth order contributions have a much more pronounced influence on the 2-1 transition than on the 1-0 transition. By spectrally isolating the 1-0 transition, the influence of fifth order contributions to vibrational echo data can be substantially reduced. Analysis of fifth order Feynman diagrams that contribute in the vibrational echo phase-matched direction demonstrates the reason for the greater influence of fifth order processes on the 1-2 transition, and that the fifth order contributions are heterodyne amplified by the third order signal. Finally, it is shown that the anharmonic oscillations in vibrational echo data of Hb–CO that previous work had attributed strictly to fifth order effects arise even without fifth order contributions.},

In the second unit, students carried out synthesis and characterization of spherical gold nanoparticles using prescribed protocols to gain some general knowledge and hands-on skills. Writing a full laboratory report on the laboratory module helped students develop intellectual appreciation of the discipline and greatly enhanced their scientific writing skills. In the last unit, each student pair carried out one research-style project in order to gain a more comprehensive experience with the complex nature of scientific inquiry. Students gained comp...},

In imidazolium ionic liquids, cation-anion interactions are controlled by selecting the appropriate anion, and the naked C(2)-H of imidazolium, which loosely interacts with its counterion, can readily interact with an H-bonding acceptable solute. The ion-counterion (solvent-solvent) interaction affects the ion-solute (solvent-solute) interaction. This relation is one of the key criteria for selecting the cation-anion combination in tailoring ILs.},

Trifluoroacetate ions have a nonexponential depopulation of the first vibrational excited state, which is well described by a kinetic mechanism involving a temperature dependent solvent assisted relaxation to the symmetric stretch mode. The vibrational spectrum of the asymmetric stretch of the (13)C=(16)O isotopologue presents an unusual spectral shape. The frequency-frequency autocorrelation function shows a static term not present in the (13)C=(16)O form, which is caused by an accidental degeneracy with a combinational mode. A newly developed frequency map for carboxylate is used to characterize the processes and dynamics observed in the frequency fluctuations of the carboxylate asymmetric stretch mode in aqueous solution. An assignment of the molecular processes that govern the frequency fluctuations is suggested from an analysis of the solvation shell configurations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.},

Concomitantly, the OH stretching lifetime decreases from approximately 500 fs at a 1:1 ratio of water and DOPC molecules (w0 = 1) to 300 fs for large water pools (ratio 16:1, w0 = 16). Two-color pump-probe studies mapping the ultrafast OH bending response after OH stretch excitation demonstrate that the relaxation pathway of the OH stretch vibration involves the OH bending mode. After OH stretch relaxation at high hydration levels, vibrational excess energy is randomized within the water pool and then transferred to the surrounding solvent. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The 8-CHBT and 5-PCH data and previously published data on 4′4′-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5-CB) are analyzed using a modification of a schematic mode coupling theory (MCT) that has been successful in describing the dynamics of supercooled liquids. At long time, the OHD-OKE data (orientational relaxation) are well described with the standard Landau-de Gennes (LdG) theory. The data decay as a single exponential. The decay time diverges as the isotropic to nematic phase transition is approached from above. Previously there has been no theory that can describe the complex dynamics that occur at times short compared to the LdG exponential decay. Earlier, it has been noted that the short-time nematogen dynamics, which consist of several power laws, have a functional form identical to that observed for the short time behavior of the orientational relaxation of supercooled liquids. The temperature-dependent orientational dynamics of supercooled liquids have recently been successfully described using a schematic mode coupling theory. The schematic MCT theory that fits the supercooled liquid data does not reproduce the nematogen data within experimental error. The similarities of the nematogen data to the supercooled liquid data are the motivation for applying a modification of the successful MCT theory to nematogen dynamics in the isotropic phase. The results presented below show that the new schematic MCT theory does an excellent job of reproducing the nematogen isotropic phase OHD-OKE data on all time scales and at all temperatures.},

abstract = {In polar fluids such as water and methanol, the peak of the solvated electron's absorption spectrum in the red has been assigned as a sum of transitions between an s-like ground state and three nearly degenerate p-like excited states bound in a quasispherical cavity. In contrast, in weakly polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), the solvated electron has an absorption spectrum that peaks in the mid-infrared, but no definitive assignment has been offered about the origins of the spectrum or the underlying structure. In this paper, we present the results of adiabatic mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamic simulations of the solvated electron in THF, and provide a detailed explanation of the THF-solvated electron's absorption spectrum and electronic structure. Using a classical solvent model and a fully quantum mechanical excess electron, our simulations show that although the ground and first excited states are bound in a quasispherical cavity, a multitude of other, nearby solvent cavities support numerous, nearly degenerate, bound excited states that have little Franck-Condon overlap with the ground state. We show that these solvent cavities, which are partially polarized so that they act as electron trapping sites, are an inherent property of the way THF molecules pack in the liquid. The absorption spectrum is thus assigned to a sum of bound-to-bound transitions between a localized ground state and multiple disjoint excited states scattered throughout the fluid. Furthermore, we find that the usual spherical harmonic labels (e.g., s-like, p-like) are not good descriptors of the excited-state wave functions of the solvated electron in THF. Our observation of multiple disjoint excited states is consistent with femtosecond pump-probe experiments in the literature that suggest that photoexcitation of solvated electrons in THF causes them to relocalize into solvent cavities far from where they originated.},

abstract = {The virtual laboratory allows for computer experiments that are not accessible via real experiments. In this work, three previously obtained charge sets were employed to study the influence of hydrogen bonding on imidazolium-based ionic liquids in molecular dynamics simulations. One set provides diffusion coefficients in agreement with the experiment and is therefore a good model for real-world systems. Comparison with the other sets indicates hydrogen bonding to influence structure and dynamics differently. Furthermore, in one case the total charge was increased and in another decreased by 0.1 e. Both the most acidic proton as well as the corresponding carbon atom were artificially set to zero, sequentially and simultaneously. In the final setup a negative charge was placed on the proton in order to introduce a barrier for the anion to contact the cation via this most acidic hydrogen atom. The following observations were made: changing the hydrogen bonding ability strongly influences the structure while the dynamic properties, such as diffusion and viscosity, are only weakly changed. However, the introduction of larger alterations (stronger hydrogen bonding and antihydrogen bonding) also strongly influences the diffusion coefficients. The dynamics of the hydrogen bond, ion pairing, and the ion cage are all affected by the level of hydrogen bonding. A change in total charges predominantly influences transport properties rather than structure. For ion cage dynamics with respect to transport porperties, we find a good correlation and a weak or no correlation for the ion pair or the hydrogen bond dynamics, respectively. Nevertheless, the hydrogen bond does influence ion cage dynamics. Therefore, we confirm that ionic liquids rather consist of loosely interacting counterions than of discrete ion pairs. Hydrogen bonding affects the properties only in a secondary or indirect manner.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectra of the cyanine dye IR144 in methanol are used to explore new aspects of optical 2D spectroscopy on a femtosecond timescale. The experiments reported here are pulse sequence and coherence pathway analogs of the two-dimensional magnetic resonance techniques known as COSY (correlated spectroscopy) and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy). Noncollinear three pulse scattering allows selection of electronic coherence pathways by choice of phase matching geometry, temporal pulse order, and Fourier transform variables. Signal fields and delays between excitation pulses are measured by spectral interferometry. Separate real (absorptive) and imaginary (dispersive) 2D spectra are generated by measuring the signal field at the sample exit, performing a 2D scan that equally weights rephasing and nonrephasing coherence pathways, and phasing the 2D spectra against spectrally resolved pump–probe signals. A 3D signal propagation function is used to correct the 2D spectra for excitation pulse propagation and signal pulse generation inside the sample. At relaxation times greater than all solvent and vibrational relaxation timescales, the experimental 2D electronic spectra can be predicted from linear spectroscopic measurements without any adjustable parameters. The 2D correlation spectra verify recent computational predictions of a negative region above the diagonal, a displacement of the 2D peak off the diagonal, and a narrowing of the 2D cross-width below the vibrational linewidth. The negative region arises from 4-level four-wave mixing processes with negative transition dipole products, the displacement off the diagonal arises from a dynamic Stokes shift during signal radiation, and the narrow 2D cross-width indicates femtosecond freezing of vibrational motion.},

Using a microfluidic mixer we have observed the rate of intramolecular diffusion within the unfolded B1 domain of protein L before it folds. The diffusion-limited rate of intramolecular contact is about 20 times slower than the rate in 6 M GdnHCl, and because in these conditions the protein is also more compact, the intramolecular diffusion coefficient decreases 100-500 times. The dramatic slowdown in diffusion occurs within the 250 micros mixing time of the mixer, and there appears to be no further evolution of this rate before reaching the transition state of folding. We show that observed folding rates are well predicted by a Kramers model with a denaturant-dependent diffusion coefficient and speculate that this diffusion coefficient is a significant contribution to the observed rate of folding.},

These different physical properties vary with molecular weight (M n) and level off near the same chain length where T g becomes independent of M n. The latter differs significantly between PS and PIB. The results suggest that neither Kuhn segment length nor molecular weight between entanglements is an important parameter for the molecular weight dependence of these properties. The most intriguing result is that the molecular weight dependencies of the fast dynamics and sound velocity observed in PS are opposite to the one observed in PIB, although T g increases with M n in both cases. Moreover, there are some indications that even variations of fragility with molecular weight in PIB might be opposite to the variations observed in PS. We speculate that difference in symmetry of the monomer structures is responsible for the opposite behavior. On the basis of this idea, predictions for dependence of the fast dynamics and fragility in various polymers on molecular weight and tacticity are formulated.},

Two-dimensional Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the coupled carbonyl stretches of Rh(CO)(2)(C5H7O2) in hexane have been obtained from femtosecond vibrational echo signals detected with spectral interferometry. The eight resonances in the two-dimensional spectrum can be interpreted as two diagonal peaks and two cross peaks, each split into a pair. The splitting between the peak pairs is directly related to the diagonal and off-diagonal anharmonicity of the symmetric and asymmetric carbonyl stretches. The ratio of the amplitude of the cross peaks for two different polarization geometries determines the projection angle between the coupled transition dipoles. The experimental characterization of the vibrational eigenstates allows the local carbonyl structure to be modeled as bilinearly coupled cubic anharmonic oscillators. The interaction between the carbonyl stretches arises from the mutual bonding with the rhodium metal center. This two-dimensional infrared experiment characterizes the structure with a time window of roughly 20 ps, suggesting a general method for capturing transient molecular structure in solution.

The time dependence of the 2D spectrum of MbCO, which is caused by protein structural evolution, is presented and its relationship to the frequency-frequency correlation function is described and used to make protein structural assignments based on comparisons to molecular dynamics simulations. The 2D vibrational echo experiments on the protein horseradish peroxidase are presented. The time dependence of the 2D spectra of the enzyme in the free form and with a substrate bound at the active site are compared and used to examine the influence of substrate binding on the protein's structural dynamics. The application of 2D vibrational echo spectroscopy to the study of chemical exchange under thermal equilibrium conditions is described. 2D vibrational echo chemical exchange spectroscopy is applied to the study of formation and dissociation of organic solute-solvent complexes and to the isomerization around a carbon-carbon single bond of an ethane derivative.},

abstract = {It is often asserted that deviation from the Nernst-Einstein relation (NE) between the molar conductivity (Lambda) and ion self-diffusion coefficients (D(i)) in ionic liquids (ILs) and molten salts is evidence for ion pairing. The NE was originally derived for noninteracting ions, as in an infinitely dilute electrolyte solution. In reality, mass, charge, momentum, and energy transport processes in ILs and molten salts involve correlated interionic collisions, caging, and vortex motions, as in any other dense liquid. Phenomenological theory using nonequilibrium thermodynamics and literature molecular dynamics simulations shows that deviations from the simple NE expression occur due to differences in cross-correlations of ionic velocities. ILs have also been shown, like molecular liquids generally, and model fluids such as the Lennard-Jones, to fit the fractional form of the Stokes-Einstein relation, D(i)/T proportional to (1/eta)(t) and Lambda proportional to (1/eta)(t), where eta is the shear viscosity. Here, it is shown that when this is the case, the NE deviation parameter Delta is then a constant, independent of temperature and pressure (consistent with experiment) and the value of the parameter t; it is a function of the ionic charges and volumes, but not the masses. Therefore, Delta is not a measure of "ionicity": it is necessary to seek other independent evidence to determine whether ion pairing is present in a given ionic liquid or molten salt. The use of "apparent" transport numbers derived from self-diffusion coefficients to describe charge transport in pure salts is argued to be unnecessary.},

The TRIR spectrometer employs broadband (150 fs, ∼150 cm −1 FWHM) mid-infrared probe and reference pulses (generated by difference frequency mixing of near-infrared pulses in type I AgGaS 2 ), which are dispersed over two 64-element linear infrared array detectors (HgCdTe). These are coupled via custom-built data acquisition electronics to a personal computer for data processing. This data acquisition system performs signal handling on a shot-by-shot basis at the 1 kHz repetition rate of the pulsed laser system. The combination of real-time signal processing and the ability to normalize each probe and reference pulse has enabled us to achieve a high sensitivity on the order of $\Delta$OD ∼ 10 −4 –10 −5 with 1 min of acquisition time. We present preliminary picosecond TRIR studies using this spectrometer and also demonstrate how a combination of TRIR and TR 3 spectroscopy can provide key information for the full elucidation of a photochemical process.},

Following photoexcitation of R3B+R3B+ or R6G+R6G+ (abbreviated as R+),R+), an electron is transferred from DMA to give the neutral radical R and the cation DMA+.DMA+. Because the DMA hole acceptor is the neat solvent, the forward transfer rate is very large, ∼5×1012 s−1.∼5×1012 s−1. The forward transfer is followed by geminate recombination, which displays a long-lived component suggesting several percent of the radicals escape geminate recombination. Spectrally resolved pump–probe experiments are used in which the probe is a “white” light continuum, and the full time-dependent spectrum is recorded with a spectrometer/charge-coupled device. Observations of stimulated emission (excited state decay—forward electron transfer), the R neutral radical spectrum, and the DMA+DMA+ radical cation spectrum as well as the ground-state bleach recovery (geminate recombination) make it possible to unambiguously follow the electron transfer kinetics. Theoretical modeling shows that the long-lived component can be explained without invoking hole hopping or spin-forbidden transitions.},

It is also possible to incorporate many different kinds of functional groups in a modular fashion. So far, most networks have been examined from the perspective of gas sorption, and this area is discussed critically and in depth in this review.

These remarkable properties result essentially from their ionic nature. Thus, the concept of ionicity of ILs (i.e. how ionic they are) is of great significance for characterising their properties. Here, we show the methodologies used to assess the ionic nature in ILs. On the basis of quantitative estimation of the ionicity, their dependence on ionic structure, polarity scales, and physicochemical properties is reviewed. The ionicity of certain ILs is also predicted from their physicochemical properties. The effects of different classes of ILs (e.g., protic ILs and lithium ILs) and binary systems consisting of ILs and other components on the ionicity are also discussed.},

Using a combination of protein semisynthesis, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we probe the ion occupancy at the S1 binding site in the constricted state of the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel when the intracellular gate is open and closed. The 2D IR spectra resolve two features, whose relative intensities depend on the state of the intracellular gate. By matching the experiment to calculated 2D IR spectra of structures predicted by MD simulations, we identify the two features as corresponding to states with S1 occupied or unoccupied by K+. We learn that S1 is >70% occupied when the intracellular gate is closed and <15% occupied when the gate is open. Comparison of MD trajectories show that opening of the intracellular gate causes a structural change in the selectivity filter, which leads to a change in the ion occupancy. This work reveals the complexity of the conformational landscape of the K+ channel selectivity filter and its dependence on the state of the intracellular gate.},

Using first-principles density functional theory and continuum solvation models, we have calculated acidity constants for pyridinium cations and their corresponding pyridinyl radicals, as well as their electrochemical redox potentials. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show that these species can be ruled out as active participants in homogeneous electrochemistry. A comparison of calculated acidities and redox potentials indicates that pyridinium cations behave differently than previously thought, and that the electrode surface plays a critical (but still unknown) role in pyridinium reduction.

Here, we review recent studies of ions at the air/water interface and compare from this perspective water with other polar solvents. For water, we focus in particular on the surface behavior of its ionic product (i.e., hydronium and hydroxide ions). We also investigate the feasibility of dielectric models for the description of the protein/water interface, in analogy to the air/water interface. Little correlation is found between these two interfaces in terms of ion segregation. Therefore, we suggest a local model of pairing of ions from the solution with charged and polar groups at the protein surface. We also describe corresponding results of experimental studies on aqueous model systems.},

While some experimental studies point towards the presence of neutral subunits in ionic liquids, many other experiments cannot confirm or even contradict their existence. Ion pairs can be detected directly in the gas phase, but no direct method is available to observe such association behavior in the liquid, and the corresponding indirect experimental proofs are based on such assumptions as unity charges at the ions. However, we have shown by calculating ionic liquid clusters of different sizes that assuming unity charges for ILs is erroneous, because a substantial charge transfer is taking place between the ionic liquid ions that reduce their total charge. Considering these effects might establish a bridge between the contradicting experimental results on this matter. Beside these results, according to molecular dynamics simulations the lifetimes of ion-ion contacts and their joint motions are far too short to verify the existence of neutral units in these materials.},

Turbulent flow created by pumping solutions through a small gap dilutes the denaturant in tens of microseconds. We have used this method to study cytochrome c folding kinetics in the previously inaccessible time range 80 micros to 3 ms. To eliminate the heme-ligand exchange chemistry that complicates and slows the folding kinetics by trapping misfolded structures, measurements were made with the imidazole complex. Fluorescence quenching due to excitation energy transfer from the tryptophan to the heme was used to monitor the distance between these groups. The fluorescence decrease is biphasic. There is an unresolved process with tau < 50 micros, followed by a slower, exponential process with tau = 600 micros at the lowest denaturant concentration (0.2 M guanidine hydrochloride). These kinetics are interpreted as a barrier-free, partial collapse to the new equilibrium unfolded state at the lower denaturant concentration, followed by slower crossing of a free energy barrier separating the unfolded and folded states. The results raise several fundamental issues concerning the dynamics of collapse and barrier crossings in protein folding.},

The vibrational spectra indicate that the two arms of the inhibitor sense quite different environments within the hydrophobic pocket. The vibrational relaxation of the two arms are almost equal at 3 ps from model studies. The 2D IR spectra expose a significant distribution of nitrile frequencies that diffuse at equilibrium on ultrafast time scales ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds. The slow spectral diffusion of the cyanovinyl arm of the inhibitor is attributed to its interaction with the backbone and side chains in the hydrophobic tunnel. The results show that the inhibitor cyano modes lose memory of their structural configurations relative to the hydrophobic pocket within tens of picoseconds. The cross-peaks between the two arms of the drug are tentatively attributed to relaxation of the nitrile state with both arms excited.},

abstract = {In this work, an equation of state (EoS) is developed to predict accurately the phase behavior of ionic liquid + CO2 systems based on the truncated perturbed chain polar statistical associating fluid theory (tPC-PSAFT) EoS. This EoS accounts explicitly for the dipolar interactions between ionic liquid molecules, the quadrupolar interactions between CO2 molecules, and the Lewis acid-base type of association between the ionic liquid and the CO2 molecules. Physically meaningful model pure-component parameters for ionic liquids are estimated based on literature data. All experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data are correlated with a single linearly temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter. The ability of the model to describe accurately carbon dioxide solubility in various 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids with different alkyl chain lengths and different anions at pressures from 0 to 100 MPa and carbon dioxide fractions from 0 to 75 mol % is demonstrated. In all cases, good agreement with experimental data is obtained.},

abstract = {Aggregation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) by self-assembly into oligomers or amyloids is a central event in Alzheimer's disease. Coordination of transition-metal ions, mainly copper and zinc, to A$\beta$ occurs in vivo and modulates the aggregation process. A survey of the impact of Cu(II) and Zn(II) on the aggregation of A$\beta$ reveals some general trends: (i) Zn(II) and Cu(II) at high micromolar concentrations and/or in a large superstoichiometric ratio compared to A$\beta$ have a tendency to promote amorphous aggregations (precipitation) over the ordered formation of fibrillar amyloids by self-assembly; (ii) metal ions affect the kinetics of A$\beta$ aggregations, with the most significant impact on the nucleation phase; (iii) the impact is metal-specific; (iv) Cu(II) and Zn(II) affect the concentrations and/or the types of aggregation intermediates formed; (v) the binding of metal ions changes both the structure and the charge of A$\beta$. The decrease in the overall charge at physiological pH increases the overall driving force for aggregation but may favor more precipitation over fibrillation, whereas the induced structural changes seem more relevant for the amyloid formation.},

abstract = {Many of water's remarkable properties arise from its tendency to form an intricate and robust hydrogen bond network. Understanding the dynamics that govern this network is fundamental to elucidating the behavior of pure water and water in biological and physical systems. In ultrafast nonlinear infrared experiments, the accessible time scales are limited by water's rapid vibrational relaxation (1.8 ps for dilute HOD in H 2 O), precluding interrogation of slow hydrogen bond evolution in non-bulk systems. Here, hydrogen bonding dynamics in bulk D 2 O were studied from the perspective of the much longer lived (36.2 ps) CN stretch mode of selenocyanate (SeCN) using polarization selective pump-probe (PSPP) experiments, two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations make use of the empirical frequency mapping approach, applied to SeCN for the first time. The PSPP experiments and simulations show that the orientational correlation function decays via fast (2.0 ps) restricted angular diffusion (wobbling-in-a-cone) and complete orientational diffusive randomization (4.5 ps). Spectral diffusion, quantified in terms of the frequency-frequency correlation function, occurs on two time scales. The initial 0.6 ps time scale is attributed to small length and angle fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds between water and SeCN. The second 1.4 ps measured time scale, identical to that for HOD in bulk D 2 O, reports on the collective reorganization of the water hydrogen bond network around the anion. The experiments and simulations provide details of the anion-water hydrogen bonding and demonstrate that SeCN is a reliable vibrational probe of the ultrafast spectroscopy of water.

abstract = {A general, transferable, polarizable force field for molecular simulation of ionic liquids (ILs) and their mixtures with molecular compounds is developed. This polarizable model is derived from the widely used CL\&P fixed-charge force field that describes most families of ILs, in a form compatible with OPLS-AA, one of the major force fields for organic compounds. Models for ILs with fixed, integer-ionic charges lead to pathologically slow dynamics, a problem that is corrected when polarization effects are included explicitly. In the model proposed here, Drude-induced dipoles are used with parameters determined from atomic polarizabilities. The CL\&P force field is modified upon inclusion of the Drude dipoles to avoid double-counting of polarization effects. This modification is based on first-principles calculations of the dispersion and induction contributions to the van der Waals interactions using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) for a set of dimers composed of positive, negative, and neutral fragments representative of a wide variety of ILs. The fragment approach provides transferability, allowing the representation of a multitude of cation and anion families, including different functional groups, without the need to reparametrize. Because SAPT calculations are expensive, an alternative predictive scheme was devised, requiring only molecular properties with a clear physical meaning, namely, dipole moments and atomic polarizabilities. The new polarizable force field, CL\&Pol, describes a broad set of ILs and their mixtures with molecular compounds and is validated by comparisons with experimental data on density, ion diffusion coefficients, and viscosity. The approaches proposed here can also be applied to the conversion of other fixed-charge force fields into polarizable versions.},

abstract = {Understanding specific ion effects on proteins remains a considerable challenge. N-methylacetamide serves as a useful proxy for the protein backbone that can be well characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The spectroscopic signatures in the amide I band reflecting the strength of the interaction of alkali cations and alkaline earth dications with the carbonyl group remain difficult to assign and controversial to interpret. Herein, we directly compute the infrared (IR) shifts corresponding to the binding of either sodium or calcium to aqueous N-methylacetamide using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the two cations interact with aqueous N-methylacetamide with different affinities and in different geometries. Because sodium exhibits a weak interaction with the carbonyl group, the resulting amide I band is similar to an unperturbed carbonyl group undergoing aqueous solvation. In contrast, the stronger calcium binding results in a clear IR shift with respect to N-methylacetamide in pure water.},

We demonstrate that Tau can specifically bind one Cu(II) ion per monomer with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range, an affinity comparable to the binding of Cu(II) to other proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases. NMR spectroscopy showed that two short stretches of residues, (287)VQSKCGS (293) and (310)YKPVDLSKVTSKCGS (324), are primarily involved in copper binding, in agreement with mutational analysis. According to circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy, Tau remains largely disordered upon binding to Cu(II), although a limited amount of aggregation is induced.},

By introducing isotope enriched amino acids into a minimal growth medium during bacterial expression, we induce uniform labeling of the amide bonds following specific amino acids, avoiding the need for chemical peptide synthesis. We use experimental data to test several common amide I frequency maps and explore the influence of various factors on map performance. Compar- ison of the predicted absorption frequencies for the four maps tested with empirical assignments to our experimental spectra yields a root-mean-square error of 6-12 cm−1, with outliers of at least 12 cm−1 in all models. This means that the predictions may be useful for predicting general trends such as changes in hydrogen bonding configuration; however, for finer structural constraints or absolute frequency assignments, the models are unreliable. The results indicate the need for careful testing of existing literature maps and shed light on possible next steps for the development of quantitative spectral maps.},

This article is aimed at newcomers to the field of SFS, and via a tutorial approach will present and develop the general sum frequency equations and then demonstrate how the fundamental theory elucidates the important experimental properties of SFS.},

abstract = {We have used time-resolved multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy, generally termed 2DIR spectroscopy, to study the equilibrium dynamics of ligand exchange in an aqueous solution containing 3.4 M Mg(ClO(4))(2) and 1.2 M NaSCN. The sensitivity of the CN stretching frequency of thiocyanate (SCN(-)) to contact ion pair formation with Mg(2+) ions generates distinct spectroscopic signatures for the MgNCS(+) contact ion pair and the free SCN(-). We have utilized 2DIR spectroscopy to successfully resolve the interconversion between these thiocyanate configurations and measured the MgNCS(+) contact ion pair dissociation time constant to be 52 +/- 10 ps. We attribute the observed dynamics to perchlorate-thiocyanate anion exchange in the first solvation shell of the Mg(2+) cation. Magnesium ions in this concentrated ionic solution will be coordinated by water molecules, as well as perchlorate and thiocyanate ions. While prior studies have observed microsecond residence times for water ligands in the first coordination sphere of Mg(2+), our study represents the first experimental observation of anion exchange in the first solvent shell of the Mg(2+) cation. We have also used orientational relaxation and spectral diffusion dynamics to quantify the dynamical distinctions between the free anion and the anion in the contact ion pair.},

Ionic liquids (ILs) were first reported as very promising high-performance lubricants in 2001 and have attracted considerable attention in the field of tribology since then because of their remarkable lubrication and anti-wear capabilities as compared with lubrication oils in general use; in recent times we have seen dramatically increased interest in the topic. The review starts with a brief introduction to ILs and fluid lubrication, and then discusses in more detail the tribological properties of IL lubricants, either as lubrication oils, additives or thin films. As well as lubrication mechanisms, some current problems and potential solutions are tentatively discussed.},

The variation of the time constants of solvent relaxation of C-153 is very small with an increase in the [bmim][PF6]/TX-100 ratio (R). The rotational relaxation time of C-153 also remains unchanged in all micremulsions of different R values. The invariance of solvation and rotational relaxation times of C-153 indicates that the position of C-153 remains unaltered with an increase in R and probably the probe is located at the interfacial region of [bmim][PF6] and TX-100 in the microemulsions. On the other hand, in the case of C-151, with an increase in R the fast component of the solvation time gradually increases and the slow component gradually decreases, although the change in solvation time is small in comparison to that of microemulsions containing common polar solvents such as water, methanol, acetonitrile, etc. The rotational relaxation time of C-151 increases with an increase in R. This indicates that with an increase in the [bmim][PF6] content the number of C-151 molecules in the core of the microemulsions gradually increases. In general, the solvent relaxation time is retarded in this room temperature ionic liquid/water-containing microemulsion compared to that of a neat solvent, although retardation is very small compared to that of the solvent relaxation time of the conventional solvent in the core of the microemulsions.},

By applying both Bennett's overlapping distribution method and Widom's particle insertion technique, we determine solvation free energies that are in excellent agreement with available experimental solubility data over a large temperature range from 300 to 500 K. We find that the computed solvation free energy of carbon dioxide is remarkably insensitive to the alkane chain length, emphasizing the importance of solvent models with accurate volumetric properties. The simulations suggest that the "anomalous" temperature dependence of the CO2 solvation at infinite dilution is characterized by counter-compensating negative entropies and enthalpies of solvation. By systematically varying the interaction strength of CO2 with the solvent, we show that the negative solvation entropy of CO2 is not caused by solvation cavities, but enforced by Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. We observe that solvation free energies and enthalpies obtained for models with different solute-solvent interaction strengths are subject to a linear correlation, similar to an expression that has been suggested for gases in polymers. Despite the apparent chain length insensitivity of the solvation free energy, significant changes in the solvation shell of a CO2 molecule are observed. The chain length insensitivity is found to be a consequence of two counter-compensating effects: the increasing free energy of cavity formation is balanced by a favorable interaction of CO2 with the alkyl chain of the imidazolium cation.},

Sum-frequency-generation 1D spectra show two peaks of the OH stretch representing two environments: near-bulk water nonadjacent to DMPC and top-layer water adjacent to DMPC. These peaks create a 2D pattern in the fourth-order signal. The asymmetric cross-peak pattern with respect to the diagonal line is a signature of coherence transfer from the higher- to the lower-frequency modes. The nodal lines in the imaginary part of the 2D spectrum show that the near-bulk water has fast spectral diffusion resembling that of bulk water despite the orientation by the strong electrostatic field of DMPC. The top-layer water has slower spectral diffusion.},

To reduce the ever-increasing CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, dry solid adsorbents with large surface-to-volume ratio such as carbonaceous materials, zeolites, and metal–organic frameworks have emerged as promising material candidates for capturing CO2. However, challenges remain because of limited CO2/N2 selectivity and long-term stability. The effective adsorption of CO2 gas (≈12 mol kg−1) on individual sheets of 2D transition metal carbides (referred to as MXenes) is reported here. It is shown that exposure to N2 gas results in no adsorption, consistent with first-principles calculations. The adsorption efficiency combined with the CO2/N2 selectivity, together with a chemical and thermal stability, identifies the archetype Ti3C2 MXene as a new material for carbon capture (CC) applications.},

abstract = {We present a new technique of broad-band heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy and demonstrate its high sensitivity allowing surface-selective measurements of vibrational spectra at submonolayer surface coverage, as low as a few percent of a monolayer. This was achieved without the help of surface enhancement phenomena, on a transparent dielectric substrate (water), and without introducing fluorescent labels, in fact, without utilizing any electronic resonances. Only the intrinsic vibrational transitions were employed for the detection of the analyte molecules (1-octanol). Unlike conventional (homodyne-detected) SFG spectroscopy, where the signal intensity decreases quadratically with decreasing surface coverage, in HD-SFG, the scaling is linear, and the signal is amplified by interference with a reference beam, significantly improving sensitivity and detection limits. At the same time, HD-SFG provides the phase as well as the amplitude of the signal and thus allows accurate subtraction of the non-resonant background--a common problem for surfaces with low concentrations of analyte molecules (i.e., weak resonant signals).},

abstract = {Looked at from the genetic point-of-view cancer represents a daunting and, frankly, confusing multiplicity of diseases (at least 100) that require an equally large variety of therapeutic strategies and substances designed to treat the particular tumor. However, when analyzed phenotypically cancer is a relatively uniform disease of very conserved 'hallmark' behaviors across the entire spectrum of tissue and genetic differences [D. Hanahan, R.A. Weinberg, Hallmarks of cancer, Cell 100 (2000) 57-70]. This suggests that cancers do, indeed, share common biochemical and physiological characteristics that are independent of the varied genetic backgrounds, and that there may be a common mechanism underlying both the neoplastic transformation/progression side and the antineoplastic/therapy side of oncology. The challenge of modern oncology is to integrate all the diverse experimental data to create a physiological/ metabolic/energetic paradigm that can unite our thinking in order to understand how both neoplastic progression and therapies function. This reductionist view gives the hope that, as in chemistry and physics, it will possible to identify common underlying driving forces that define a tumor and will permit, for the first time, the actual calculated manipulation of their state. That is, a rational therapeutic design. In the present review, we present evidence, obtained from a great number of studies, for a fundamental, underlying mechanism involved in the initiation and evolution of the neoplastic process. There is an ever growing body of evidence that all the important neoplastic phenotypes are driven by an alkalization of the transformed cell, a process which seems specific for transformed cells since the same alkalinization has no effect in cells that have not been transformed. Seen in that light, different fields of cancer research, from etiopathogenesis, cancer cell metabolism and neovascularization, to multiple drug resistance (MDR), selective apoptosis, modern cancer chemotherapy and the spontaneous regression of cancer (SRC) all appear to have in common a pivotal characteristic, the aberrant regulation of hydrogen ion dynamics [S.

Oncog. 6 (1) (1995) 1-33].

For example, it is possible to detect the endogenous fluorescence from a small number of important biomolecules, including NADH and FAD, which are two coenzymes involved in key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we review different imaging approaches to isolate the fluorescence from these chromophores in two- and three-dimensional samples and discuss the origins and potential interpretation of the observed signals in terms of cell metabolic status. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of these approaches, as well as important research directions that we expect will evolve in the near future.},

abstract = {Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrosco-py (2DIR) is most commonly simulated within the framework of the exciton method. The key parameters for these calculations include the frequency of the oscillators within their molecular environments and coupling constants that describe the strength of coupling between the oscillators. It is shown that these quantities can be obtained directly from harmonic frequency calculations by exploiting a procedure that localizes the normal modes. This approach is demonstrated using the amide I modes of polypeptides. For linear and cyclic diamides and hexapeptide Z-Aib-L-Leu-(Aib) 2 -Gly-Aib-OtBu, the computed parameters are compared with those from existing schemes, and the resulting 2DIR spectra are consistent with experimental observations. The incorporation of conformational averaging of structures from molecular dynamics simulations is discussed, and a hybrid scheme wherein the Hamiltonian matrix from the quantum chemical local-mode approach is combined with fluctuations from empirical schemes is shown to be consistent with experiment. The work demonstrates that localized vibrational modes can provide a foundation for the calculation of 2DIR spectra that does not rely on extensive parametrization and can be applied to a wide range of systems. For systems that are too large for quantum chemical harmonic frequency calculations, the local-mode approach provides a convenient platform for the development of site frequency and coupling maps. ■ INTRODUCTION Conventional infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a long-established technique for probing the structure of molecules. For larger molecules, IR spectra often become congested with many overlapping bands that can make spectra hard to interpret, with the consequence that much of the information contained within the spectra is lost. Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR) is the IR analogue to two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and reviews of this technique are available elsewhere. 1−5 In 2DIR spectroscopy, the signal is generated from three ultrashort IR pulses and probes multiple quantum transitions, providing information on the coupling between vibrational modes, vibrational anharmonicities, and line broadening. Another feature of 2DIR spectroscopy is the polarization conditions of the IR pulses, which can be used to suppress or enhance different spectral features. Through spreading the transitions over a second frequency domain, 2DIR reveals more information by exposing cross peaks that correlate with the coupling between different vibrational modes. 6,7,12,13 In recent years, 2DIR has emerged as a powerful technique for studying chemical and biological sys-tems. 1−5,14−18 One key advantage of 2DIR, compared with two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, is its time resolution that can probe structural changes on the picosecond time scale. The amide I band of polypeptides and proteins is predominantly associated with the carbonyl stretch of the amide group and shows distinctive spectral characteristics depending on the nature of the secondary structure. The amide I band is particularly amenable to 2DIR spectroscopy, and 2DIR has been applied to study polypeptides and pro-teins, 6−11,13−19 for example, monitoring the unfolding of a $\beta$-turn through the evolution of the cross peaks as the $\beta$-turn opened and inter-residue hydrogen bonds weakened.},

abstract = {Although the Ca2+ aqua-ion is of great importance to biology and a key component of natural groundwaters, many details of the solvation structure and its behavior have remained either unexplored or controversial. We report the findings of a new neutron diffraction study, building upon the results of an earlier, complementary investigation with EXAFS (Fulton, J. L.; Badyal, Y. S.; Simonson, J. M.; Heald, S. M. J. Phys. Chem. A 2003, 107, 4688?4696). The common goal of both studies was to develop a much clearer and more consistent picture of the effects of concentration on the Ca2+ solvation structure. In particular, we have tried to elucidate the microscopic basis of a thermodynamic anomaly reported for ambient aqueous solutions of CaCl2 at concentrations greater than approximately 4.0 m. By measuring the neutron scattering from isotopically distinct (natCa/44Ca) pairs of CaCl2 aqueous solutions at two concentrations (4.0 and 6.4 m) in both light and heavy water, the uniquely detailed Ca?H and Ca?X (X = O, Cl, or Ca) pair distribution functions, and the changes in them with concentration, were determined. This type of second-order isotope difference experiment has only been applied successfully before to two other aqua-ions, Ni2+ and Cr3+. Our findings confirm the lack of substantial change in the nearest atomic neighbor Ca?O environment and the virtual absence of Ca2+?Cl- contact ion pairing even at high concentration, as first indicated by the preceding EXAFS investigation. Instead, the principal change with concentration appears to be the entry of significant numbers of Cl- ions into the second hydration shell around Ca2+ and the resulting formation of Ca2+?OH2?Cl- solvent-shared ion pairs. Our results provide compelling evidence for this picture, in particular the impact on the water hydrogen structure in the second hydration shell and the apparent effects on the tilt angle distribution of water molecules in the first hydration layer. The average number of water molecules in the first hydration shell of Ca2+ is close to 7 at both concentrations (although a small decrease with concentration is noticeable). Given the great rigor and consistency required for second-order isotope difference experiments, our values for coordination number and other structural parameters should be regarded as the benchmarks for this system. The pair distribution functions will also serve as an exacting test of theoretical and simulation models.},

abstract = {We investigated salt interactions with butyramide as a simple mimic of cation interactions with protein backbones. The experiments were performed in aqueous metal chloride solutions using two spectroscopic techniques. In the first, which provided information about contact pair formation, the response of the amide I band to the nature and concentration of salt was monitored in bulk aqueous solutions via attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that molar concentrations of well-hydrated metal cations (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Li(+)) led to the rise of a peak assigned to metal cation-bound amides (1645 cm(-1)) and a decrease in the peak associated with purely water-bound amides (1620 cm(-1)). In a complementary set of experiments, the effect of cation identity and concentration was investigated at the air/butyramide/water interface via vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. In these studies, metal ion-amide binding led to the ordering of the adjacent water layer. Such experiments were sensitive to the interfacial partitioning of cations in either a contact pair with the amide or as a solvent separated pair. In both experiments, the ordering of the interactions of the cations was: Ca(2+) > Mg(2+) > Li(+) > Na(+) K(+). This is a direct cationic Hofmeister series. Even for Ca(2+), however, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the cation with the amide carbonyl oxygen was no tighter than 8.5 M. For Na(+) and K(+), no evidence was found for any binding. As such, the interactions of metal cations with amides are far weaker than the analogous binding of weakly hydrated anions.},

abstract = {It is well known that histidine is involved in many biological functions due to the structural versatility of its side chain. However, probing the conformational transitions of histidine in proteins, especially those occurring on an ultrafast time scale, is difficult. Herein we show, using a histidine dipeptide as a model, that it is possible to probe the tautomer and protonation status of a histidine residue by measuring the two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectrum of its amide I vibrational transition. Specifically, for the histidine dipeptide studied, the amide unit of the histidine gives rise to three spectrally resolvable amide I features at approximately 1630, 1644, and 1656 cm(-1), respectively, which, based on measurements at different pH values and frequency calculations, are assigned to a $\tau$ tautomer (1630 cm(-1) component) and a $\pi$ tautomer with a hydrated (1644 cm(-1) component) or dehydrated (1656 cm(-1) component) amide. Because of the intrinsic ultrafast time resolution of 2D IR spectroscopy, we believe that the current approach, when combined with the isotope editing techniques, will be useful in revealing the structural dynamics of key histidine residues in proteins that are important for function.},

abstract = {Water in contact with mineral interfaces is important for a variety of different processes. Here, we present a combined theoretical/experimental study which provides a quantitative, molecular-level understanding of the ubiquitous and important CaF 2 /water interface. Our results show that, at low pH, the surface is positively charged, causing a substantial degree of water ordering. The surface charge originates primarily from the dissolution of fluoride ions, rather than from adsorption of protons to the surface. At high pH we observe the presence of Ca-OH species pointing into the water. These OH groups interact remarkably weakly with the surrounding water, and are responsible for the " free OH " signature in the VSFG spectrum, which can be explained from local electronic structure effects. The quantification of the surface termination, near-surface ion distribution and water arrangement is enabled by a combination of advanced phase-resolved Vibrational Sum Frequency Generation spectra of CaF 2 / water interfaces and state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations which include electronic structure effects. At the interface, the properties of a given system may be drastically different from those observed in the bulk. For water at hydrophobic interfaces, e.g. the water-air interface, the hydrogen-bonded network of water is abruptly interrupted, and non-hydrogen-bonded, " free OH " groups appear, pointing away from the bulk. For water at polar solids, i.e. at mineral surfaces, the charge at the surface as well as the polar groups may be responsible for specific hydrogen bonds and may align the water through strong electrostatic interactions. Water-mineral interactions are of general importance for a wide range of environmental, chemical, metallurgical, and ceramic processes 1,2},

abstract = {We report on a low voltage, straight/smooth surface, and efficient active micromixer. The mixing principle is based on alternative ion depletion-enrichment using a pair of positively charged polyelectrolytic gel electrodes (pPGEs), which face each other joined by a microchannel. This system has an external AC signal source electrically connected to the pPGEs via the respective 1 M KCl solutions and Ag/AgCl electrodes. When an electric bias is applied between the two pPGEs, anions are extracted through one of the pPGEs to create a local ion-deficient region. Simultaneously, an ion-rich area appears near the other pPGE due to an inward anionic flux. As the direction of the charge flow is periodically reversed by the AC signal source, the ion depletion-enrichment regions are alternately swapped with each other on the 'push-pull' basis. The turmoil between the pPGEs quickly mixes the solutions in the microchannel without any mechanical moving part or specially machined structures. In the proposed system, both AC frequency and current density can be easily and finely controlled so that one can quickly find the optimal conditions for a given sample. The micromixer as made showed a mixing efficiency higher than 90% for sample solutions of 1 mM Rhodamine 6G and PBS at pH 7.4 when the flow rate was under 6 mm s(-1). In addition to the solution-solution mixing, the micromixer can effectively mix suspended microparticles with solution. As a representative example, rapid and efficient lysis of human red blood cells was demonstrated allowing minimal damage of the white blood cells.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are salts that are liquid at low temperature (<100 degrees C) which represent a new class of solvents with nonmolecular, ionic character. Even though the first representative has been known since 1914, ionic liquids have only been investigated as solvents for transition metal catalysis in the past ten years. Publications to date show that replacing an organic solvent by an ionic liquid can lead to remarkable improvements in well-known processes. Ionic liquids form biphasic systems with many organic product mixtures. This gives rise to the possibility of a multiphase reaction procedure with easy isolation and recovery of homogeneous catalysts. In addition, ionic liquids have practically no vapor pressure which facilitates product separation by distillation. There are also indications that switching from a normal organic solvent to an ionic liquid can lead to novel and unusual chemical reactivity. This opens up a wide field for future investigations into this new class of solvents in catalytic applications.},

However, when a reaction initiated by 33-femtosecond deep ultraviolet laser pulses is used to eject highly rotationally excited diatomic molecules into alcohols and water, rotational coherence persists for many rotational periods despite the solvent. Molecular dynamics simulations trace this slow development of molecular-scale friction to a clearly identifiable molecular event: an abrupt liquid-structure change triggered by the rapid rotation. This example shows that molecular relaxation can sometimes switch from linear to nonlinear response.},

abstract = {The amide I vibrational mode, primarily associated with peptide-bond carbonyl stretches, has long been used to probe the structures and dynamics of peptides and proteins by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. A number of ab initio-based amide I vibrational frequency maps have been developed for calculating IR line shapes. In this paper, a new empirical amide I vibrational frequency map is developed. To evaluate its performance, we applied this map to a system of isotope-edited CD3-zeta membrane peptide bundles in aqueous solution. The calculated 2D-IR diagonal line widths vary from residue to residue and show an asymmetric pattern as a function of position in the membrane. The theoretical results are in fair agreement with experiments on the same system. Through analysis of the computed frequency time-correlation functions, it is found that the 2D-IR diagonal widths are dominated by contributions from the inhomogeneous frequency distributions, from which it follows that these widths are a good probe of the extent of local structural fluctuations. Thus, the asymmetric pattern of line widths follows from the asymmetric structure of the bundle in the membrane.},

abstract = {At the air/liquid interface, cation binding specificity of alkaline earth cations, Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), with the biologically relevant ligand carboxylate (COO(-)) using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy is reported. The empirical evidence strongly supports that the ionic binding strength is much stronger for Ca(2+) to COO(-) than that for Mg(2+). We conclude that at a near-neutral pH, the mechanism that governs Ca(2+) binding to COO(-) is accompanied by commensurate deprotonation of the carboxyl headgroup. In addition, surface molecular structure and ion concentration influence the cation binding behavior at the air/liquid interface. In a 0.1 M Ca(2+)(aq) solution, Ca(2+) initially favors forming ionic complexes in a 2:1 bridging configuration (2Ca(2+):1COO(-)) but 1:1 chelating bidentate complexes (1Ca(2+):1COO(-)) gradually emerge as secondary species as the system reaches equilibrium. As the Ca(2+) concentration rises to 0.3 M, the primary complexed species exists in the 2:1 bridging configuration. Unlike Ca(2+), Mg(2+) at 0.1 and 0.3 M favors a solvent-separated ionic complex with COO(-).},

abstract = {Early reports stated that Au was a catalyst of choice for the BOR because it would yield a near complete faradaic efficiency. However, it has recently been suggested that gold could yield to some extent the heterogeneous hydrolysis of BH, therefore lowering the electron count per BH, especially at low potential. Actually, the blur will exist regarding the BOR mechanism on Au as long as no physical proof regarding the reaction intermediates is not put forward. In that frame, in situ physical techniques like FTIR exhibit some interest to study the BOR. Consequently, in situ infrared reflectance spectroscopy measurements (SPAIRS technique) have been performed in 1 M NaOH/1 M NaBH(4) on a gold electrode with the aim to detect the intermediate species. We monitored several bands in B-H (nu ∼ 1180, 1080 and 972 cm(-1)) and B-O bond regions (nu = 1325 and ∼1425 cm(-1)), which appear sequentially as a function of the electrode polarization. These absorption bands are assigned to BH(3), BH(2) and BO species. At the light of the experimental results, possible initial elementary steps of the BOR on gold electrode have been proposed and discussed according to the relevant literature data.},

abstract = {To facilitate computational investigation of intermolecular interactions in the solution phase{,} we report the development of ALMO-EDA(solv){,} a scheme that allows the application of continuum solvent models within the framework of energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs). In this scheme{,} all the quantum mechanical states involved in the variational EDA procedure are computed with the presence of solvent environment so that solvation effects are incorporated in the evaluation of all its energy components. After validation on several model complexes{,} we employ ALMO-EDA(solv) to investigate substituent effects on two classes of complexes that are related to molecular CO2 reduction catalysis. For [FeTPP(CO2-$\kappa$C)]2− (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin){,} we reveal that two ortho substituents which yield most favorable CO2 binding{,} –N(CH3)3+ (TMA) and –OH{,} stabilize the complex via through-structure and through-space mechanisms{,} respectively. The coulombic interaction between the positively charged TMA group and activated CO2 is found to be largely attenuated by the polar solvent. Furthermore{,} we also provide computational support for the design strategy of utilizing bulky{,} flexible ligands to stabilize activated CO2via long-range Coulomb interactions{,} which creates biomimetic solvent-inaccessible “pockets” in that electrostatics is unscreened. For the reactant and product complexes associated with the electron transfer from the p-terphenyl radical anion to CO2{,} we demonstrate that the double terminal substitution of p-terphenyl by electron-withdrawing groups considerably strengthens the binding in the product state while moderately weakens that in the reactant state{,} which are both dominated by the substituent tuning of the electrostatics component. These applications illustrate that this new extension of ALMO-EDA provides a valuable means to unravel the nature of intermolecular interactions and quantify their impacts on chemical reactivity in solution.},

abstract = {Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in polyatomic liquids and solutions can be studied in unprecedented detail using ultrafast incoherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy to monitor the decay of a parent vibration generated with a tunable mid-IR pump pulse, and the appearance of daughter excitations at lower frequencies. A 2D vibrational spectroscopy technique results from fixing the mid-IR pump pulse and obtaining a time series of anti-Stokes Raman spectra. A 3D technique results from obtaining 2D spectra as a function of pump frequency. This 3D technique is presently the most powerful method available for studying VER in condensed phases. It provides information on VER mechanisms and pathways, liquid-state structural relaxation resulting in spectral diffusion, excitation transfer among sites with different local structures, strong correlations between vibrations as a result of Fermi resonance, and extremely weak anharmonic interactions resulting in VER via multistep vibrational cascades. The technique is illustrated by recent results obtained with ambient temperature associated liquids water (and deuterated water) and methanol, and by new measurements of strong correlations between CH stretching and bending and OH stretching and bending vibrations in methanol. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.},

We had suggested that this cooling mode is the ONO bend vibration. Furthermore, molecules that have initially been excited by the OH stretch vibration of cis-HONO and then underwent isomerization follow the same relaxation pathway. In the present study, we extend the investigation of IVR of cis- and trans-HONO to the N=O stretch and HON bend spectral regions, finding further evidence that the bottleneck of trans cooling is indeed the ONO bend vibration. In combination with information on the anharmonic coupling constants of different modes, the energy relaxation dynamics preceding this cooling cascade can also be followed in unprecedented detail.},

@article{Son2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The behavior of polymers in complex solvents is interesting from a fundamental perspective and of practical importance from the standpoint of polymer processing. There has been recent interest in the conformational and dynamic properties of polymer in room temperature ionic liquids, with conflicting predictions from computations using models with different resolutions and conflicting results of experiments from different groups. In this work, we develop a first-principles, nonpolarizable united atom (UA) force field for a mixture of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in the ionic liquid BMIM+BF4-. The UA force field is benchmarked against ab initio calculations, and the PEO atomic charges are parametrized to implicitly capture the polarization contribution to the solvation energy of a single PEO molecule in BMIM+BF4-. The UA model allows one to perform multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. This is necessary because the conformational relaxation correlation times are of the order of 100 ns. The simulations predict that the radius of gyration, Rg, scales with molecular weight, Rg∼ Mw$\nu$ with $\nu$ ≈ 0.56 in the temperature range 300-600 K, consistent with experiment, seemingly in between a self-avoiding walk and an ideal chain. An examination of the snapshots of the polymer demonstrates, however, that the polymer conformations are composed of ringlike and linear segments, with ringlike parts of the chain wrapped around cations of the ionic liquid. The slow dynamics arises from the barrier to unwrapping the ringlike segments of the polymer. The mean-square displacement shows three regimes which we interpret as confinement, Zimm, and diffusive. The simulations emphasize the importance of accurate force fields and microsecond simulations in obtaining reliable results for polymers and elucidate important correlation effects for polymers in strongly interacting solvents.},

The reaction is caused by an interaction between the anion and cation that allows proton transfer, and involves a phosphonium ylide intermediate. The cation reaction can be mitigated by using ammonium rather than phosphonium cations. Thus, phosphonium and ammonium cations paired with aprotic heterocyclic anions (AHAs) react with CO2 through different mechanisms at elevated temperatures. This work shows that careful consideration of both physical properties and chemical reactivity of ILs based on AHA anions is needed when designing ionic liquids for CO2 separations.},

In PMMA, a glass, the echo decay is exponential at all the temperatures studied, and the dephasing rate increases linearly with increasing temperature. In 2-MTHF, there is a change in the functional form of the temperature dependence when the solvent goes through the glass transition temperature (Tg).(Tg). Below Tg,Tg, the dephasing rate increases linearly with temperature, while above Tg,Tg, it rises very steeply in a nonlinear manner. In the liquid at higher temperatures, the vibrational echo decays are nonexponential. A model frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) is proposed in which the FFCF differs for a glass and a liquid because of the intrinsic differences in the nature of the dynamics. At least two motions, inertial and diffusive, contribute to the vibrational dephasing in the liquids. The different temperature dependences of inertial and diffusive motions are discussed. Comparison of the model calculations of the vibrational echo temperature dependence and the data show reasonable, but not quantitative agreement.},

Nevertheless, during past years, some works revealed that those green solvents in fact could present certain toxicity levels. This is the reason why some biocompounds from natural sources, such as choline, amino acids, and organic acids, for synthesis of ILs have showed to be alternatives. This means that there is evidence that ILs with low or nontoxic effects could be synthesized, possibly overcoming the major drawback of using them in the food industry. Applications of these third generation ILs, or even the most common ILs, in food processes are scarce and mainly focused on extraction processes and chemical analysis methods. These works have proven that, considering the physical properties of ILs of interest for the food industry such as melting profile, solubility, viscoelasticity, and high biocompatibility, when compared to those commonly used, ILs are alternatives ...},

abstract = {Cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures are common motifs in biological systems, providing structural stability and mediating proton transfer for redox reactions. The mechanism of proton transfer across hydrogen-bonded interfaces depends on the strength of the intermolecular coupling between bridging OH/NH vibrational modes. Here we present a novel ultrafast continuum mid-IR spectroscopy experiment to study the vibrational dynamics of the 7-azaindole-acetic acid (7AI-Ac) heterodimer as a model system for asymmetric cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. In addition to spreading of the excitation across the whole OH band within the time resolution of the experiment, excitation of a 300 cm(-1) region of the ∼1000 cm(-1) broad OH stretching mode of the acetic acid monomer leads to a frequency shift in the NH stretching mode of the 7AI monomer. This indicates that the NH and OH stretching modes located on the two monomers are strongly coupled despite being separated by 750 cm(-1). The strong coupling further causes the OH and NH bands to decay with a common decay time of ∼2.5 ps. This intermolecular coupling is mediated through the hydrogen-bonded structure of the 7AI-Ac heterodimer and is likely a general property of cyclic hydrogen-bonded structures. Characterizing the vibrational dynamics of and the coupling between the high-frequency OH/NH modes will be important for understanding proton transfer across such molecular interfaces.},

abstract = {The hydrogen ion is one of the most important species in aqueous solutions, as well as in protic ionic liquids (PILs). PILs are important potential alternatives to H2O for swelling the proton exchange membranes (PEMs) and improving the high-temperature performance of fuel cells. The hydrogen ion (H(+)) or hydronium (H3O(+)) solvation mechanism is not only a fundamental principle of acid/base chemistry in ionic liquids but also key to understanding the charge- and proton-transport properties of the PIL solutions. In this paper, a PIL system was prepared by mixing 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4) IL with an aqueous solution of a strong acid, HBF4. Water can be partially evaporated from the solution under a vacuum at room temperature. Conductivity and vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) measurements were used in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the molecular-level solvation of H(+) and H2O in the IL solution. When water is present at high molar fraction, the cations (BMI(+) and H(+)) and anions (BF4(-)) are both solvated by water and the solutions have high conductivity. After water evaporation, the PIL solution has excess H(+) and reduced conductivity, which is still significantly higher than that of pure BMIBF4. Vibrational spectroscopy suggests that the BMI(+) and BF4(-) ions are desolvated from water during the water evaporation. DFT calculations assist the interpretation of the vibrational spectroscopy and show that the remaining water is in the form of H3O(+) solvated by the IL molecular ions. Hence, the species remaining after evaporation is a ternary PIL consisting of BMI(+) cation, BF4(-) anion, and H3O(+) cation. The H3O(+) may be the principle charge carrier in the PIL solution and responsible for the high solution conductivity.},

abstract = {X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was used to probe the effects of concentration on the first-shell structure of Ca2+ in aqueous solution. Measurements were carried out under ambient conditions using a bending magnet beamline (sector 20) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne. The Ca K-edge EXAFS spectrum for 6 m CaCl2 yielded no evidence for the formation of significant numbers of Ca2+{\^{a}}ˆ'Cl- contact ion pairs even at such high concentration, a result confirmed by comparison with the data for a dilute (0.2 m) reference solution of the perchlorate. A mean coordination number of 7.2 {\^{A}}± 1.2 water molecules and an average Ca{\^{a}}ˆ'O distance of 2.437 {\^{A}}± 0.010 {\~{A}}{\ldots}were determined for 6 m CaCl2, and these parameters are also consistent with earlier EXAFS measurements on dilute Ca2+ solutions. Comparison of the pre-edge and near-edge (XANES) spectrum against those for various references, including the crystalline hydrates, provided further confirmation of the lack of change in the Ca2+ first-shell structure and symmetry. Our measurements help clarify the earlier results of modeling thermodynamic data that imply that some significant structural change occurs at high salt concentration. Taken together, our results suggest the formation of Ca2+{\^{a}}ˆ'OH2{\^{a}}ˆ'Cl- solvent-shared ion pairs, rather than Ca2+{\^{a}}ˆ'Cl- contact ion pairs, is most likely responsible for the unusual thermodynamic behavior of this system. The EXAFS spectrum for an even more concentrated (9.2 m CaCl2) hexahydrate melt, however, did indicate the presence of some contact ion pairs. The new results agree closely with those of an earlier X-ray diffraction study, and serve to further aid interpretation of the aqueous solutions data. On a technical note, a previously unreported multielectron excitation edge at k = 10.2 {\~{A}}{\ldots}-1 was detected in the EXAFS spectra and assigned to the KLII,III transition. Inclusion of this new transition, along with the other known (KMII,III and KMI) transitions, in the background correction procedure significantly improved the quality of EXAFS fits. Further improvements resulted from the inclusion of Ca{\^{a}}ˆ'H single scattering paths to treat the protons on the tightly bound water molecules. A Ca{\^{a}}ˆ'H distance of 2.97 {\~{A}}{\ldots}was obtained, which is in excellent agreement with the results of neutron scattering measurements (reported in part II). This appears to be the most convincing evidence to date for the detection of proton backscattering in EXAFS measurements of the local structure around ions in aqueous solution.},

However, a major limitation of this simplified description is the neglect of quantum decoherence induced by the different interactions between two distinct quantum states and their environment, which can strongly affect the predicted energy-transfer rate and vibrational spectra. Here, we use quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations to determine the vibrational quantum decoherence time for an OH stretch vibration in liquid heavy water. We show that coherence is lost on a sub-100 fs time scale due to the different responses of the first shell neighbors to the ground and excited OH vibrational states. This ultrafast decoherence induces a strong homogeneous contribution to the linear infrared spectrum and suggests that resonant vibrational energy transfer in H2O may be more incoherent than previously thought.},

abstract = {A macroscopic treatment of solvated ion dynamics is developed and applied to calculate the limiting (zero concentration) conductance of cations in several aprotic solvents. The theory is based on a coupled set of electrostatic and hydrodynamic equations for the density, flow, and polarization fields induced in the polar solvent by a moving ion. These equations, which are derived by the Mori projection technique, include crucial local solvent structure (ion solvation) effects through solvent compressibility, and local constitutive parameters. If solvent structure is suppressed, the equations reduce to those derived previously by Onsager and Hubbard [J. B. Hubbard and L. Onsager, J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4850 (1977)]. The macroscopic equations are approximately decoupled into electrostatic and hydrodynamic parts. The decoupled equations are solved assuming a step density, viscosity, and dielectric constant model for the local solvent structure and dynamics. This yields analytic expressions for the viscous, $\zeta$V, and dielectric $\zeta$D, contributions to the ion friction coefficient. These expressions generalize, respectively, the Stokes and Zwanzig results for the (slip) viscous and dielectric friction so as to account for ion solvation effects. The friction coefficients involve a desolvation function $\Delta$ which depends on the local structure (density) and dynamics of the solvent. The drag coefficient results reduce in form to those of Zwanzig (within a flow gradient correction factor of 2/3) and Stokes for both weak ($\Delta$→1) and strong ($\Delta$→0) ion–solvent interaction. For $\Delta$→1 the true ionic radius Ri appears in the drag formulas while for $\Delta$→0 a renormalized solvated ion radius $\sigma$=Ri+2Rs (where Rs=solvent molecule radius) appears. The theory is fit to experimental cation conductances in pyridine, acetone, and acetonitrile by representing $\Delta$ by a two parameter switching function. Agreement between the model and experiment is satisfactory for all three solvents. Moreover dielectric friction is found to have a negligible effect on ion mobility in these solvents.},

abstract = {Continuum electrostatics models for ions in water provide apparent long range electrostatic explanations for the forces on ions. However the electro-chemical free energy of solvation of ions resides largely in the first two water layers, which control the interfacial behavior of the ions and require explicit modeling to capture their distinctive behaviors. The resulting short range forces produce such surprising charge density-dependent behaviors as ion adsorption onto nonpolar surfaces, like charge aggregation of ions, and substantial ion pairing preferences, which arise largely from the affinity of specific ions for individual water molecules. Specific ion effects controlled by the local water affinity of the ion show a diagnostic change of sign between strongly hydrated Na(+) and weakly hydrated K(+) and between strongly hydrated F(-) and weakly hydrated Cl(-), in both cases marking the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution, a critical benchmark missing from continuum electrostatics models.},

abstract = {We carried out classical molecular dynamics simulations with a standard and two quantum chemistry based charge sets to study the ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C(4)C(1)im][Br]. We split the cation up into different charge groups and found that the total charge and the charge distribution in the imidazolium ring are completely different in the three systems while the total charge of the butyl chain is much better conserved between the methods. For comparison, the spatial distribution functions and the radial distribution functions as well as different time correlation functions were calculated. For the structural properties we obtained a good agreement between the standard and one of the two quantum chemistry based sets, while the results from the second quantum chemistry based set led to a completely different picture. The opposite was observed for the dynamic properties, which agree well between the standard set and the second quantum chemistry based set, whereas the dynamics in the first charge set obtained by quantum chemistry calculations proceeded much too slow, which is not obvious from the total charge. We observed, that the structure of the butyl chain is mostly unaffected by the choice of the charge set. This is an indirect proof for separation into ionic parts and nonpolar domains. A second focus of the article is the investigation of dynamical heterogeneity and the ion cages. Therefore, we analyzed the reorientational dynamics in the three systems and at five different temperatures in system with the standard charge set. Generally speaking, we detected four different time domains. The fastest movement can be found for the continuous hydrogen bond and the nearest neighbor ion pair dynamics. In the second time domain the movement of the butyl chain took place. The third time domain consisted in the increasing movement of the imidazolium ring as well as in the continuous distortion of an ion cage, i.e., the departure of one of the several counterions from the central ion's first shell, and the intermittent hydrogen bond dynamics. The remaining domain involves the translational displacement of the ions.},

Here, we illustrate the ability of L-4-nitrophenylalanine to serve as a sensitive IR probe of local protein environments in the 247 residue superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Specifically, the nitro symmetric stretching frequency of L-4-nitrophenylalanine was shown to be sensitive to both solvents that mimic different protein environments and (15)N isotopic labeling of the three-atom nitro group of this UAA. (14)NO(2) and (15)NO(2) variants of this UAA were incorporated utilizing an engineered orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair into a solvent exposed and a partially buried position in sfGFP with high efficiency and fidelity. The combination of isotopic labeling and difference FTIR spectroscopy permitted the nitro symmetric stretching frequency of L-4-nitrophenylalanine to be experimentally measured at either site in sfGFP. The (14)NO(2) symmetric stretching frequency red-shifted 7.7 cm(-1) between the solvent exposed and partially buried position, thus illustrating the ability of this UAA to serve as an effective IR probe of local protein environments.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe general trends to be expected at short times when an excess electron is generated or injected in different room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Perhaps surprisingly, the excess electron does not localize systematically on the positively charged cations. Rather, the excess charge localization pattern is determined by the cation and anion HOMO/LUMO gaps and, more importantly, by their relative LUMO alignments. As revealed by experiments, the short-time (ps/ns) transient UV spectrum of excess electrons in RTILs is often characterized by two bands, a broad band at low energies (above 1000 nm) and another weaker band at higher energies (around 400 nm). Our calculations show that the dry or presolvated electron spectrum (fs) also has two similar features. The broad band at low energies is due to transitions between electronic states with similar character on ions of the same class but in different locations of the liquid. The lower-intensity band at higher energies is due to transitions in which the electron is promoted to electronic states of different character, in some cases on counterions. Depending on the chemical nature of the RTIL, and especially on the anions, excess electrons can localize on cations or anions. Our findings hint at possible design strategies for controlling electron localization, where electron transfer or transport across species can be facilitated or blocked depending on the alignment of the electronic levels of the individual species.},

The results illustrate that the vibrational lifetimes and orientational relaxation time scales vary dramatically between the four samples and do not correlate with the amount of water relative to surfactant or solute in solution.

abstract = {In the broad water stretching band (2900-3700 cm(-1)), frequency-dependent vibrational energy relaxation (VER), and spectral diffusion both occur on the time scale of a few picoseconds. Ultrafast IR-Raman spectroscopy of water is used to study both processes. VER is also studied in solutions of HDO in D2O (HDO/D2O). The OH stretch (nu(OH)) lifetime for water and HDO is similar to 1 ps. The OD stretch (nu(OD)) lifetime for D2O is similar to 2 ps. Stretch decay generates substantial excitation of the bending modes. The lifetimes of bending vibrations (delta) in H2O, HDO, and D2O can be estimated to be in the 0.6 ps less than or equal to T-1 less than or equal to 1.2 ps range. nu(OH) decay in water produces delta(H2O) With a quantum yield 1.0 less than or equal to phi 2.0. In HDO/D2O solutions, v(OH)(HDO) decay generates nu(OD)(D2O). delta(HDO), and delta(D2O). The quantum yield for generating nu(OD)(D2O) is phi approximate to 0.1. The quantum yield for generating both delta(HDO) and delta(D2O) is phi greater than or equal to 0.6. Thus, each nu(OH)(HDO) decay generates at minimum 1.2 quanta of bending excitation. After narrow-band pumping, the distribution of excitations within the stretch band of water evolves in time. Pumping on the blue edge instantaneously (within similar to 1 ps) generates excitations throughout the band. Pumping on the red edge does not instantaneously generate excitations at the blue edge. Excitations migrate uphill to the blue edge on the 0-2 ps time scale. The fast downhill spectral diffusion is attributed to excitation hopping among water molecules in different structural environments. The slower uphill spectral diffusion is attributed to evolution of the local liquid structure. Shortly after excitations are generated, an overall redshift is observed that is attributed to a dynamic vibrational Stokes shift. This dynamic shift slows down the rate of excitation hopping. Then energy redistribution throughout the band becomes slow enough that the longer VER lifetimes of stretch excitations on the blue edge can lead to a gradual blue shift of population over the next few picoseconds.},

These shifts yield quantitative information on electric fields that can be directly compared with electrostatics calculations. We show that extensive molecular dynamics simulations and ensemble averaging are required to reproduce the observed changes in field.},

By introducing a third time point at which the hydrogen-bonding state of phenol is measured (in comparison with 2D IR exchange spectroscopy), the spectroscopic method can serve as a critical test of whether the spectroscopic coordinate used to observe the exchange process is a memory-free, or Markovian, coordinate. For the system under investigation, the 3D IR results suggest that this is not the case. This conclusion is reconfirmed by accompanying molecular dynamics simulations, which furthermore reveal that the non-Markovian kinetics is caused by the heterogeneous structure of the mixed solvent.},

abstract = {Vibrational relaxation in methanol-d, ethanol-d, and 1-propanol-d dissolved in CCl4 has been measured with ultrafast infrared pump−probe experiments. Non-hydrogen-bond donating OD stretches (∼2690 cm-1) are excited. For concentrations ≤2.5 mol %, alcohol monomers dominate the pump−probe signals, and all three alcohols yield monoexponential decays with decay times of ∼2 ps (varying somewhat for the different alcohols). In the 5 mol % samples studied, molecules associated with oligomers dominate the signals. The signals decay to negative values (increased absorption), but the rates of the vibrational excited state decays are unchanged from those observed in the 2.5 mol % samples. The negative signals recover on two time scales. We propose a model in which hydrogen bond dissociation, following vibrational relaxation, increases the concentration of non-hydrogen-bond donating hydroxyl groups and produces the observed negative signal. The observation of the same decay rates with and without hydrogen bond dissociation indicates that hydrogen bond breaking does not involve a new OD stretch relaxation pathway. Using a set of kinetic equations, the time constants for hydrogen bond dissociation and reformation have been determined to be 2−3 ps for breaking and roughly 20 ps and >10 ns for reformation. The fast recovering component of the negative signal reflects hydrogen bond reformation to an extent determined by a new local equilibrium temperature within the laser excitation volume. The slow recovering component reflects the slow diffusion of thermal energy out of the laser excitation volume.},

abstract = {Intramolecular disulfide bonds are understood to play a role in regulating protein stability and activity. Because disulfide bonds covalently link different components of a protein, they influence protein structure. However, the effects of disulfide bonds on fast (subpicosecond to approximate to 100 ps) protein equilibrium structural fluctuations have not been characterized experimentally. Here, ultrafast 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy is used to examine the constraints an intramolecular disulfide bond places on the structural fluctuations of the protein neuroglobin (Ngb). Ngb is a globin family protein found in vertebrate brains that binds oxygen reversibly. Like myoglobin (Mb), Ngb has the classical globin fold and key residues around the heme are conserved. Furthermore, the heme-ligated CO vibrational spectra of Mb (Mb-CO) and Ngb (Ngb-CO) are virtually identical. However, in contrast to Mb, human Ngb has an intramolecular disulfide bond that affects its oxygen affinity and protein stability. By using 2D-IR vibrational echo spectroscopy, we investigated the equilibrium protein dynamics of Ngb-CO by observing the CO spectral diffusion (time dependence of the 2D-IR line shapes) with and without the disulfide bond. Despite the similarity of the linear FTIR spectra of Ngb-CO with and without the disulfide bond, 2D-IR measurements reveal that the equilibrium sampling of different protein configurations is accelerated by disruption of the disulfide bond. The observations indicate that the intramolecular disulfide bond in Ngb acts as an inhibitor of fast protein dynamics even though eliminating it does not produce significant conformational change in the protein's structure.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a multifunctional Ca2+-binding protein that regulates the activity of many enzymes in response to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. There are two globular domains in CaM, each containing a pair of helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs called EF-hands. Ca2+-binding induces the opening of both domains thereby exposing hydrophobic pockets that provide binding sites for the target enzymes. Here, I present a 2.4 A resolution structure of a calmodulin mutant (CaM41/75) in which the N-terminal domain is locked in the closed conformation by a disulfide bond. CaM41/75 crystallized in a tetragonal lattice with the Ca2+ bound in all four EF-hands. In the closed N-terminal domain Ca ions are coordinated by the four protein ligands in positions 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the loop, and by two solvent ligands. The glutamate side-chain in the 12th position of the loop (Glu31 in site I and Glu67 in site II), which in the wild-type protein provides a bidentate Ca2+ ligand, remains in a distal position. Based on a comparison of CaM41/75 with other CaM and troponin C structures a detailed two-step mechanism of the Ca2+-binding process is proposed. Initially, the Ca2+ binds to the N-terminal part of the loop, thus generating a rigid link between the incoming helix (helix A, or helix C) and the central beta structure involving the residues in the sixth, seventh and eighth position of the loop. Then, the exiting helix (helix B or helix D) rotates causing the glutamate ligand in the 12th position to move into the vicinity of the immobilized Ca2+. An adjustment of the phi, psi backbone dihedral angles of the Ile residue in the eighth position is necessary and sufficient for the helix rotation and functions as a hinge. The model allows for a significant independence of the Ca2+-binding sites in a two-EF-hand domain.},

We relied on cationic substitution to obtain proton conducting yet environmentally benign non-fluorinated ionic liquids. By developing binary systems of PILs with different cations, eutectic compositions of PILs with drastically lowered melting points were demonstrated. Through thermal analyses of these binary systems, phase diagrams were constructed which allowed us to obtain eutectic binary PIL mixtures exhibiting a liquidus range from ? 70 ?C to 150 ?C. These eutectic PIL mixtures were incorporated into polymer systems to develop non-aqueous thin film proton-conducting polymer electrolytes for solid pseudocapacitors. The proton conductivity of the eutectic ionic liquids was observed in the polymer electrolyte systems and promoted pseudocapacitive behavior in solid and liquid capacitor cells.},

abstract = {The transient absorption spectrum in the range 500 nm-1000 nm was measured with ultrafast time resolution on a flowing neat, aliphatic, room-temperature ionic liquid following anion photodetachment. In this region the spectrum was shown to be a combination of absorption from the electron and the hole. Spectrally-resolved electron quenching determined a bimodal shape for the hole spectrum in agreement with recent computational predictions on a smaller aliphatic ionic liquid [Margulis et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 20186 (2011)]. For time delays beyond 15 ps, spectral evolution qualitatively agrees with recent radiolysis experiments [Wishart et al., Faraday Discuss. 154, 353 (2012)]. However, the shape of the spectrum is different, reflecting the contrast in ionization energy between the two methods. Previously unobserved reactivity of the electron was found with a time constant of 300 fs. The results demonstrate solvent control of the rate coefficient for reaction between the electron and proton, with a rapid decline in the rate within the first picosecond.},

abstract = {Lignocellulose represents a key sustainable source of biomass for transformation into biofuels and bio-based products. Unfortunately, lignocellulosic biomass is highly recalcitrant to biotransformation, both microbial and enzymatic, which limits its use and prevents economically viable conversion into value-added products. As a result, effective pretreatment strategies are necessary, which invariably involves high energy processing or results in the degradation of key components of lignocellulose. In this work, the ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][CH3COO]), was used as a pretreatment solvent to extract lignin from wood flour. The cellulose in the pretreated wood flour becomes far less crystalline without undergoing solubilization. When 40% of the lignin was removed, the cellulose crystallinity index dropped below 45, resulting in > 90% of the cellulose in wood flour to be hydrolyzed by Trichoderma viride cellulase. [Emim] [CH3COO] was easily reused, thereby resulting in a highly concentrated solution of chemically unmodified lignin, which may serve as a valuable source of a polyaromatic material as a value-added product.},

abstract = {The ultrafast dynamics of a de novo metalloenzyme active site is monitored using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. The homotrimer of parallel, coiled coil $\alpha$-helices contains a His3-Cu(I) metal site where CO is bound and serves as a vibrational probe of the hydrophobic interior of the self-assembled complex. The ultrafast spectral dynamics of Cu-CO reveals unprecedented ultrafast (2 ps) nonequilibrium structural rearrangements launched by vibrational excitation of CO. This initial rapid phase is followed by much slower ∼40 ps vibrational relaxation typical of metal-CO vibrations in natural proteins. To identify the hidden coupled coordinate, small molecule analogues and the full peptide were studied by QM and QM/MM calculations, respectively. The calculations show that variation of the histidines' dihedral angles in coordinating Cu controls the coupling between the CO stretch and the Cu-C-O bending coordinates. Analysis of different optimized structures with significantly different electrostatic field magnitudes at the CO ligand site indicates that the origin of the stretch-bend coupling is not directly due to through-space electrostatics. Instead, the large, ∼3.6 D dipole moments of the histidine side chains effectively transduce the electrostatic environment to the local metal coordination orientation. The sensitivity of the first coordination sphere to the protein electrostatics and its role in altering the potential energy surface of the bound ligands suggests that long-range electrostatics can be leveraged to fine-tune function through enzyme design.},

abstract = {A new intrinsic localization algorithm is suggested based on a recently developed mathematical measure of localization. No external criteria are used to define a priori bonds, lone pairs, and core orbitals. It is shown that the method similarly to Edmiston–Ruedenberg's localization prefers the well established chemical concept of $\sigma$–$\pi$ separation, while on the other hand, works as economically as Boys' procedure. For the application of the new localization algorithm, no additional quantities are to be calculated, the knowledge of atomic overlap intergrals is sufficient. This feature allows a unique formulation of the theory, adaptable for both ab initio and semiempirical methods, even in those cases where the exact form of the atomic basis functions is not defined (like in the EHT and PPP calculations). The implementation of the procedure in already existing program systems is particularly easy. For illustrative examples, we compare the Edmiston–Ruedenberg and Boys localized orbitals with those calculated by the method suggested here, within both the CNDO/2 and ab initio frameworks (using STO‐3G and 6‐31G∗∗ basis sets) for several molecules (CO, H2CO, B2H6, and N2O4). Some similarities concerning the localization procedures of von Niessen as well as Magnasco and Perico are also discussed.},

abstract = {Monolayer films of nucleic acids on solid supports are encountered in a range of diagnostic and bioanalytical applications. These applications often rely on elevated temperatures to improve performance; moreover, studies at elevated temperatures can provide fundamental information on layer organization and functionality. To support such applications, this study compares thermostability of oligonucleotide monolayers immobilized to gold by first coating the gold with a nanometer-thick film (an "anchor layer") of a polymercaptosiloxane, to which DNA oligonucleotides are subsequently tethered through maleimide-thiol conjugation, with thermostability of monolayers formed via widely used attachment through a terminal thiol moiety on the DNA. The temperature range covered is from 25 to 90 °C. After confirming stability of immobilization and, more importantly, retention of hybridization activity even under the harshest conditions investigated, these thermostable films are used to demonstrate measurements of (1) reversible surface melting transitions and (2) temperature dependence of competitive hybridization, when fully matched and mismatched sequences compete for binding to immobilized DNA oligonucleotides. The competitive hybridization experiments reveal a pronounced impact of temperature on rates of approach to equilibrium, with kinetic freezing into nonequilibrium states close to room temperature and rapid approach to equilibrium at elevated temperatures. Modeling of competitive surface hybridization equilibria using thermodynamic parameters derived from surface melting transitions of the individual sequences is also discussed.},

We find that the influence of reorientation depends significantly on both the functional group in question and the polarization conditions used. Additionally, under some circumstances, reorientation can cause the VSFG response function to grow with time, partially counteracting the effects of other dephasing mechanisms.},

abstract = {The structure of the transmembrane domain of CD3-zeta a component of the T-cell receptor involved in signal transduction, has been studied in its native state (a lipid bilayer) by multiple site-specific infrared dichroism. For the first time, the transmembrane domain has been labelled at multiple positions along the sequence, representing a total of 11 samples, each labelled at a different residue with an isotopically modified carbonyl group, C-13=O-18. A strategy is outlined that, based on the above data, can yield the rotational orientation and the local helix tilt for each labelled residue, giving a detailed description of helix geometry. The results obtained indicate that the transmembrane segment is in an a-helical conformation throughout, with an average helix tilt of 12 degrees. The N-terminal side of the helix is more tilted than the C-terminal. In an accompanying paper we describe the implementation of the infrared data in a model-building study of the CD3-zeta transmembrane complex. The model obtained is entirely consistent with results based on evolutionary conservation data. Taken together, this study represents the first step towards elucidation of the backbone structure of a transmembrane a-helical bundle by infrared spectroscopy. (C)2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Ultrafast infrared transient absorption measurements of the complete hydroxyl OD stretching mode spectrum of HOD in water, from 100 fs to tens of picoseconds, observe hydrogen bond breaking and monitor the equilibration of the hydrogen bond network in water. In addition, the vibrational lifetime, the time constant for hydrogen bond breaking, and the rate of orientational relaxation are determined. The reactant and photoproduct spectra of the hydrogen bond breaking process are identified by decomposing the transient spectra into two components, the initial spectrum associated with vibrational excited states (reactants) and the long-time spectrum associated with broken hydrogen bonds (photoproducts). By properly taking into account the perturbation of the reactant spectrum decay by the growth of the photoproduct spectrum, it is found that the vibrational relaxation (1.45 ps) and orientational relaxation (1.53 ps) are wavelength independent and, therefore, independent of the degree of hydrogen bonding. Energy deposited into water by vibrational relaxation does not immediately break a hydrogen bond by predissociation nor produce a thermally equilibrated hydrogen bond distribution at an elevated temperature. Following deposition of energy by vibrational relaxation, the hydrogen bond breaking time is 800 fs, and there is a transient period of several picoseconds during which the hydrogen bond distribution is not in thermal equilibrium.},

abstract = {Solvation of iodide and electrons in an ionic liquid (N,N,N-trimethyl-n-propylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide; TMPA-TFSI) was studied through the absorption spectra of the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) state of iodide and of solvated electrons. The interaction between the TMPA cation and iodide was strong, whereas electrons were weakly solvated in TMPA-TFSI. We followed electron photodetachment from iodide to the ionic liquid and formation of the solvated electrons by observing absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions using a nanosecond laser flash photolysis method. The quantum yield of the photodetachment in TMPA-TFSI was estimated to be 0.34, which is much higher than that in a high-concentration aqueous salt solution previously reported. We also examined a reaction of the solvated electrons with the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Bmim-TFSI) as a solute in TMPA-TFSI. The reaction rate was determined to be 5.3 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). The electrons before full solvation (dry electrons) reacted with Bmim cations efficiently. These observations suggest that the electrons in TMPA-TFSI can move easily before solvation.},

abstract = {We present an instantaneous‐normal‐mode analysis of liquid water at room temperature based on a computer simulated set of liquid configurations and we compare the results to analogous inherent‐structure calculations. The separate translational and rotational contributions to each instantaneous normal mode are first obtained by computing the appropriate projectors from the eigenvectors. The extent of localization of the different kinds of modes is then quantified with the aid of the inverse participation ratio—roughly the reciprocal of the number of degrees of freedom involved in each mode. The instantaneous normal modes also carry along with them an implicit picture of how the topography of the potential surface changes as one moves from point to point in the very‐high dimensional configuration space of a liquid. To help us understand this topography, we use the instantaneous normal modes to compute the predicted heights and locations of the nearest extrema of the potential. The net result is that in liquid water, at least, it is the low frequency modes that seem to reflect the largest‐scale structural transitions. The detailed dynamics of such transitions are probably outside of the instantaneous‐normal‐mode formalism, but we do find that short‐time dynamical quantities, such as the angular velocity autocorrelation functions, are described extraordinarily well by the instantaneous modes.},

The observed pressure-temperature-composition (PTx) data have been analyzed by use of an equation-of-state (EOS) model, which has been successfully applied for our previous works. Henry's law constants have been obtained from the observed (PTx) data directly and/or from the EOS correlation. Ten RTILs among the present ionic liquids results in the physical absorption, and eight RTILs show the chemical absorption. The classification of whether the absorption is the physical or chemical type is based on the excess Gibbs and enthalpy functions as well as the magnitude of the Henry's constant. In the chemical absorption cases, the ideal association model has been applied in order to interpret those excess thermodynamic functions. Then, two types of the chemical associations (AB and AB2, where A is CO2 and B is RTIL) have been observed with the heat of complex formations of about -11 (for AB) and from -27 to -37 (for AB2) kJ x mol(-1), respectively.},

abstract = {The problem of photoinduced donor−acceptor electron transfer in liquid solution is analyzed to obtain an understanding of the relationship between approximate treatments of the role of diffusion in electron transfer, that is, the Collins−Kimball approach, and a detailed analysis of the problem. It is shown why previous analyses of experimental data have yielded distance dependences of electron transfer that are much too long range. From an appropriate fitting of the nonstationary kinetics of donor fluorescence quenching by diffusion-assisted electron transfer, the effective radii and the steady-state constants associated with electron transfer are found for a donor−acceptor system studied experimentally in seven solvents with different viscosities. The dependence of diffusion agrees with the one predicted theoretically for electron transfer having a distance-dependent transfer rate initially taken to be exponential with distance. In the fast-diffusion limit, the dependence on the rate of diffusion is well approximated by the Collins−Kimball relationship, which permits the kinetic rate constant and the effective radius associated with diffusion-induced quenching to be extracted from the experimental data. The effective radius is then related to the electron transfer rate with arbitrary distance dependence. From this relationship, the tunnelling length for both exponential and Marcus-type rates is obtained from the data analysis, and it is demonstrated that the latter is almost twice as long as the former. For the Marcus transfer rate, it is found that the Marcus parameter $\beta$ = 1.2 {\AA}-1 ($\beta$ = 2/tunnelling length), which is in accord with previous measurements on a variety of systems. The theoretical analysis presented here resolves the apparent discrepancies between early measurements of very long tunnelling lengths in liquid systems and physically reasonable values of $\beta$ ≈ 1 {\AA}-1.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the PT rates of intramolecular O{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O hydrogen-bonded systems in solution through the (1)H spin-lattice relaxation times of the hydroxyl protons, induced by the (1)H-(17)O dipolar interactions (T(1dd)(OH)), taking into account the contribution of the OH reorientational motion to T(1dd)(OH). Solutions of the benzoic acid dimer (BA dimer), 1-benzoyl-6-hydroxy-6-phenylfulvene (Fulvene), and dibenzoylmethane (DBM) were chosen as test systems. For Fulvene in CCl(4), the PT time, $\tau$(PT), was deduced to be 7 × 10(-11) s. In the case of the BA dimer in CCl(4), the $\tau$(PT) value was considerably greater than the OH reorientational correlation time, $\tau$(R(OH)) = 4.3 × 10(-11) s. In contrast, the experimental results for DBM in CCl(4) indicated that the proton is located about midway between the two oxygen atoms, that is, the PT potential energy surface is a single well or a double well with a PT barrier near or below the zero-point energy.},

abstract = {The widely-used blood anticoagulants citrate and EDTA give rise to prominent peaks in (1)H NMR spectra of plasma samples collected in epidemiological and clinical studies, and these cause varying levels of interference in recovering biochemical information on endogenous metabolites. To investigate both the potential metabolic information loss caused by these substances and any possible inter-molecular interactions between the anticoagulants and endogenous components, the (1)H NMR spectra of 40 split human plasma samples collected from 20 individuals into either citrate or EDTA have been analysed. Endogenous metabolite peaks were selectively obscured by large citrate peaks or those from free EDTA and its calcium and magnesium complexes. It is shown that the endogenous metabolites that give rise to peaks obscured by those from EDTA or citrate almost invariably also have other resonances that allow their identification and potential quantitation. Also, metabolic information recovery could be maximised by use of spectral editing techniques such as spin-echo, diffusion-editing and J-resolved experiments. The NMR spectral effects of any interactions between the added citrate or EDTA and endogenous components were found to be negligible. Finally, identification of split samples was feasible using simple multivariate statistical approaches such as principal components analysis. Thus even when legacy epidemiological plasma samples have been collected using the NMR-inappropriate citrate or EDTA anticoagulants, useful biochemical information can still be recovered effectively.},

abstract = {Model calculations are performed on the amide‐I infrared (ir) bands of globular proteins by assigning one oscillator with a transition dipole to each peptide group. Coupling between these oscillators is introduced through the transition dipole coupling mechanism. As examples of application of the model, the ir spectra in the amide‐I region of eight representative proteins, viz., carbonmonoxy myoglobin, ribonuclease A, $\alpha$‐lactalbumin, lysozyme, flavodoxin, carboxypeptidase A, concanavalin A, and $\beta$‐trypsin are calculated. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated and observed amide‐I band envelopes. Some structure‐spectrum correlations are discussed on the basis of the model calculations. The presence of bands with significant ir intensities for myoglobin in the region below 1640 cm−1 is consistent with its x‐ray structure having no $\beta$ sheet. Analysis of the contributions of $\beta$ sheets to the amide‐I band envelopes shows that parallel, antiparallel, and mixed parallel/antiparallel $\beta$ sheets give rise to strong ir bands at a similar position in the wave number region below 1650 cm−1, and that no band in the region above 1650 cm−1 can be regarded as a reliable marker of antiparallel $\beta$ sheets. The contributions of non‐$\alpha$‐non‐$\beta$ parts spread over a wide wave number region. The differences in the amide‐I band envelopes between $\alpha$‐lactalbumin and lysozyme originate most probably from the structural differences between the $\alpha$‐helical parts near the N termini of these proteins.},

The requirements for viability of membranes vary somewhat with each application. Nevertheless, the key requirements of durability, productivity and separation efficiency must be balanced against cost in all cases. The various `contender' technologies for large scale gas separation membrane applications and the gas transport mechanisms are considered. The current spectrum of applications of gas separation membranes include; nitrogen enrichment, oxygen enrichment, hydrogen recovery, acid gas (CO2, H2S) removal from natural gas and dehydration of air and natural gas. The current status and the limitations faced by the available membrane materials for each of these applications are discussed. Two key technical challenges exist. Achieving higher permselectivity for the relevant application with at least equivalent productivity is the first of these challenges. Maintaining these properties in the presence of complex and aggressive feeds is the second challenge. Attractive avenues to overcome these challenges for each application will be presented. Finally, several new membrane applications with immense potential (e.g. fuel cells and olefin-paraffin separations) are discussed.},

Under optimal conditions, PEL induced much higher yields in the IL than in tert-butanol, while in the IL PEL-catalyzed conversions were higher than those catalyzed by Novozym 435. The catalytic processes were improved by recycling both the enzyme (Novozym 435) and the IL ([BMIm][PF6]) and by searching for new enzymes and new ILs. The impact of ILs on biodiesel production has been discussed, and the interactions between the IL, the substrate, and the enzyme are believed to play an important role in governing the conversion. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Dielectric spectra have been measured for aqueous sodium oxalate solutions up to the saturation concentration (0.04 less than or equal to c [mmol L-1] less than or equal to 0.25) at 25degreesC over the approximate frequency range 0.2 less than or equal to v [GHz] less than or equal to 20. The spectra exhibit a process at about 1 GHz associated with the presence of ion pairs, in addition to the dominant solvent relaxation process at about 18 GHz. Detailed analysis of the solvent dispersion amplitude indicates that the oxalate ion is highly hydrated but that its solvation sheath is "fragile", decreasing quickly with increasing solute concentration. The NaOx(aq)(-) ion pair is shown to be of the double-solvent-separated (2SIP) type, with an infinite dilution association constant K-A = 1.04 +/- 0.02. Analysis of the ion-pair relaxation time as a function of solute concentration gave rate constants for the formation (k12 = (7.3 +/- 0.4) 10(9) L mol(-1) s(-1)) and dissociation (k(21) = (6.7 +/- 0.5) 10(8) s(-1)) of the ion pair. These values are reasonably close to the diffusion-controlled values predicted by the Eigen theory, consistent with a 2SIP structure for the ion-pair.},

@article{Perrin2010,
abstract = {In a symmetric hydrogen bond (H-bond), the hydrogen atom is perfectly centered between the two donor atoms. The energy diagram for hydrogen motion is thus a single-well potential, rather than the double-well potential of a more typical H-bond, in which the hydrogen is covalently bonded to one atom and H-bonded to the other. Examples of symmetric H-bonds are often found in crystal structures, and they exhibit the distinctive feature of unusually short length: for example, the O-O distance in symmetric OHO H-bonds is found to be less than 2.5 {\AA}. In comparison, the O-O distance in a typical asymmetric H-bond, such as ROH{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}OR(2), ranges from about 2.7 to 3.0 {\AA}. In this Account, we briefly review and update our use of the method of isotopic perturbation to search for a symmetric, centered, or single-well-potential H-bond in solution. Such low-barrier H-bonds are thought to be unusually strong, owing perhaps to the resonance stabilization of two identical resonance forms [A-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}B ↔ A{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H-B]. This presumptive bond strength has been invoked to explain some enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Yet in solution, a wide variety of OHO, OHN, and NHN H-bonds have all been found to be asymmetric, in double-well potentials. Examples include the monoanion of (±)-2,3-di-tert-butylsuccinic acid and a protonated tetramethylnaphthalenediamine, even though these two ions are often considered prototypes of species with strong H-bonds. In fact, all of the purported examples of strong, symmetric H-bonds have been found to exist in solution as pairs of asymmetric tautomers, in contrast to their symmetry in some crystals. The asymmetry can be attributed to the disorder of the local solvation environment, which leads to an equilibrium among solvatomers (that is, isomers that differ in solvation). If the disorder of the local environment is sufficient to break symmetry, then symmetry itself is not sufficient to stabilize the H-bond, and symmetric H-bonds do not have an enhanced stability or an unusual strength. Nor are short H-bonds unusually strong. We discuss previous evidence for "short, strong, low-barrier" H-bonds and show it to be based on ambiguous comparisons. The role of such H-bonds in enzyme-catalyzed reactions is then ascribed not to any unusual strength of the H-bond itself but to relief of "strain."},

Polar−apolar alternation defines their nanoscale structural heterogeneity, whereas positive−negative charge alternation defines short length scale order. Much progress has been made in the past few years as it pertains to the theoretical interpretation of X-ray scattering experiments for these liquids. Our group has contributed to the development of theoretical interpretation guidelines for the analysis of their structure function. Perhaps less well developed is our understanding of how transport and dynamics in general couple to the very unique structure of ionic liquids which are often dynamically and structurally heterogeneous. This article attempts to present our most current understanding of ionic liquid structure in general and its coupling to transport and dynamics in minimally technical terms for the benefit of the broadest audience.},

abstract = {Separation and purification technologies for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) with a low energy footprint are sought after. For adsorption-based separation processes, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained increasing attention because of their tailored structures and functionalized pore surfaces. However, there are practical issues with the deployment of MOFs in industrial processes because of the lack of their long term structural stability, energy intensive regeneration and production challenges on large scales. Herein, we introduce MUF-17 as a robust MOF that combines an excellent CO2 adsorption performance and a broad suite of favorable characteristics. MUF-17 possesses one-dimensional zig-zag pores that are lined with amino and carboxylate groups enabling optimal interactions with guest CO2 molecules. Equally important, MUF-17 is easily synthesized from inexpensive starting reagents using a scalable reflux process. It is stable in the presence of water vapour. The high performance of MUF-17 and its applicability to applied settings were confirmed by breakthrough measurements in the absence and presence of humidity, multiple adsorption desorption cycles, and pelletization with a polymeric binder.},

abstract = {We use temperature-dependent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) of dilute HOD in H2O to investigate hydrogen bond rearrangements in water. The OD stretching frequency is sensitive to its environment, and loss of frequency correlation provides a picture of local and collective hydrogen bond dynamics. The time scales for hydrogen bond rearrangements decrease from roughly 2 ps at 278 K to 0.5 ps at 345 K. We find the barrier to dephasing and hydrogen bond switching to be Ea = 3.4 ± 0.5 kcal/mol, although the trend is slightly non-Arrhenius. The value is in good agreement with the reported barrier height for OD reorientation observed in pump−probe anisotropy measurements. This provides evidence for the proposal that hydrogen bond switching occurs through concerted large angular jump reorientation. MD simulations of temperature-dependent OD vibrational dephasing and orientational correlation functions are used to support our conclusions.},

Although there is an increasing number of reports dealing with the application of ionic liquids as solvents for organic synthesis, their use in polymer synthesis is still limited. In the last few years, however, it has been shown that ionic liquids can be advantageously used also for polymer synthesis. In radical polymerization the increase of k(p)/k(1) ratio for polymerizations conducted in ionic liquids has been observed. Application of ionic liquids as solvents for Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization facilitates separation of the polymer from residual catalyst and reduces the extent of side-reactions. These and the other polymerization systems in which ionic liquids were used as solvents are discussed in the article mainly on the basis of results published in last five years.

Here we report the generation of deuterated carbonic acid in deuterium oxide solution by ultrafast protonation of bicarbonate and its persistence for nanoseconds. We follow the reaction dynamics upon photoexcitation of a photoacid by monitoring infrared-active marker modes with femtosecond time resolution. By fitting a kinetic model to the experimental data, we directly obtain the on-contact proton-transfer rate to bicarbonate, previously inaccessible with the use of indirect methods. A Marcus free-energy correlation supports an associated pKa (Ka is the acid dissociation constant) of 3.45 +/- 0.15, which is substantially lower than the value of 6.35 that is commonly assumed on the basis of the overall carbon dioxide-to-bicarbonate equilibrium. This result should spur further exploration of acid-base reactivity in carbon dioxide-rich aqueous environments such as those anticipated under sequestration schemes.},

Thus, the mixing process of two distinct ions of equal sign embedded in a constant field network of a given counterion was analyzed. All systems exhibit small, positive V(E) values of the order of a few tenths of cm(3) mol(-1), which are essentially temperature and pressure independent. The results show additive trends, for instance, the V(E) values become larger as the difference between the alkyl chain lengths of the two cations increases. The Flory theory of mixtures provides a useful, semiquantitative correlation between the excess volumes and excess enthalpies in these systems, allowing for comparison with analogous results obtained within the linear primary alcohols.},

Although the folding of ACBP was initially described as a concerted two-state process, the tryptophan fluorescence measurements revealed a previously unresolved phase with a time constant tau = 80 micros, indicating formation of an intermediate with only slightly enhanced fluorescence of Trp-55 and Trp-58 relative to the unfolded state. To amplify this phase, a dansyl fluorophore was introduced at the C terminus by labeling an I86C mutant of ACBP with 5-IAEDANS [5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid]. Continuous-flow refolding of guanidine HCl-denatured ACBP showed a major increase in tryptophan-dansyl fluorescence energy transfer, indicating formation of a partially collapsed ensemble of states on the 100-micros time scale. A subsequent decrease in dansyl fluorescence is attributed to intramolecular quenching of donor fluorescence on formation of the native state. The kinetic data are fully accounted for by three-state mechanisms with either on- or off-pathway intermediates. The intermediate accumulates to a maximum population of 40%, and its stability depends only weakly on denaturant concentration, which is consistent with a marginally stable ensemble of partially collapsed states with approximately 1/3 of the solvent-accessible surface buried. The findings indicate that ultrafast mixing methods combined with sensitive conformational probes can reveal transient accumulation of intermediate states in proteins with apparent two-state folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Steady-state and transient conformational changes upon the thermal unfolding of ubiquitin were investigated with nonlinear IR spectroscopy of the amide I vibrations. Equilibrium temperature-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy reveals the unfolding of the $\beta$-sheet of ubiquitin through the loss of cross peaks formed between transitions arising from delocalized vibrations of the $\beta$-sheet. Transient unfolding after a nanosecond temperature jump is monitored with dispersed vibrational echo spectroscopy, a projection of the 2D IR spectrum. Whereas the equilibrium study follows a simple two-state unfolding, the transient experiments observe complex relaxation behavior that differs for various spectral components and spans 6 decades in time. The transient behavior can be separated into fast and slow time scales. From 100 ns to 0.5 ms, the spectral features associated with $\beta$-sheet unfolding relax in a sequential, nonexponential manner, with time constants of 3 $\mu$s and 80 $\mu$s. By modeling the amide I vibrations of ubiquitin, this observation is explained as unfolding of the less stable strands III–V of the $\beta$-sheet before unfolding of the hairpin that forms part of the hydrophobic core. This downhill unfolding is followed by exponential barrier-crossing kinetics on a 3-ms time scale.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic and surface-specific spectroscopic investigations were carried with an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) containing 16 aspartic acid residues. The goal was to explore the role of the carboxylate moieties in hydrophobic collapse and related Hofmeister effects. Experiments were conducted with a series of monovalent and divalent metal chloride salts. Both phase transition temperature and spectroscopic data demonstrated that the divalent cations showed relatively strong association to the carboxylate sites on the biopolymer with K(d) values in the range of 1 to 10 mM. The ordering of the divalent series was: Zn(2+) > Ca(2+) > Ba(2+) > Sr(2+) > Mg(2+). Monovalent cations displayed weaker binding which ranged from 78 mM for NH(4)(+) to 345 mM for Cs(+). The order for this series was: NH(4)(+) > Li(+) > Na(+) > NMe(4)(+) > K(+) > Rb(+) ≥ Cs(+). These results are in general agreement with the notion that strongly hydrated cations bind more tightly to carboxylate groups than do weakly hydrated cations. Moreover, the data for the monovalent series was partially consistent with the law of matching water affinity, although Li(+) and NH(4)(+) did not follow the model. The series for the divalent cations did not appear to obey the law of matching water affinity at all.},

abstract = {Treating the glass temperature TG of polymers as an iso‐free volume state allows one to derive the result ($\alpha$ L —$\alpha$ G ). TG =K 1, a constant; or the approximate result $\alpha$ LTG =K 2, another constant. The $\alpha$\&apos;s are the coefficients of cubical expansion for 100% amorphous polymer above and below TG. K 1 is 0.113 for a wide variety of polymers differing in cohesive energy density, chain stiffness, and geometry. We thus have a general criterion for TG. K 2 is 0.164. This latter relation combined with the principle of corresponding states, results in an expression for Tg as a function of cohesive energy density and chain rigidity. The polyalkyl methacrylates which have side‐chain transitions below TG follow the first equation if $\alpha$ G is replaced by $\alpha$ G ′, the expansion coefficient below the side‐chain transition. Polymer‐solvent systems are similar to the polyalkylmethacrylates. Two additional products, $\alpha$ L {\textperiodcentered}TM and $\Delta$CP {\textperiodcentered}TG , where TM is the melting point of the polymer and $\Delta$CP is the jump in specific heat at TG , are approximately constant.},

abstract = {Biological membranes form supramolecular aggregates composed of lipids and proteins to which carbohydrate may be covalently bound. To be able to study membrane structure and function it is usually necessary to dissociate the membrane into its components. The techniques for extraction and analysis of the membrane lipids are well worked out, and are mainly based on the use of organic solvents. These have also been used to extract the proteins, but the resultant irreversible aggregation and denaturation of many membrane proteins limit their usefulness. Partial and selective protein solubilization can be obtained by a number of methods involving chelating agents, manipulation of ionic strength and pH. Protein perturbants (i.e. urea, guanidine and chaotropic agents) and enzymatic digestion have also been used. However, these procedures do not lead to solubilization of the proteins which are more strongly bound to the lipid matrix of the membrane. For such proteins the use of detergents (synthetic detergents, bile salts and saponins) appears to provide the most generally useful extraction method presently available. The literature on the use of detergents in membrane solubilization is vast, and scattered. Their use has largely been empirical, and few guidelines on the mechanisms of action have been available [1-6]. To make things even more difficult for a reviewer, there is another large body of data on the properties of detergents in aqueous solutions. This field constitutes a branch of science in itself, the knowledge of which is essential for the proper use of detergents. It is not the intention of this article to review systematically the literature on detergents, and try to compile an exhaustive catalogue of facts and references. This would be quite a hopeless task. Instead, we will focus our attention on the work that deals with the mechanisms of detergent action. Useful generalisations are beginning to emerge from recent work. From a short general survey of the properties of detergents we proceed to model lipid systems and to detergent-protein interactions before turning to the possible sequence of events when detergents interact with biological membranes.},

abstract = {Multiple 4-$\mu$s molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the folding process of the cross-linked $\alpha$-helical peptide Ac-EACAR5EAAAR10EAACR15Q-NH2 (EAAAR peptide). The folding kinetics are single exponential at 330 K, while they are complex at 281 K with a clear deviation from single-exponential behavior, in agreement with time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements. Network analysis of the conformation space sampled by the MD simulations reveals four main folding channels which start from conformations with partially formed helical structure and non-native salt-bridges in a kinetically partitioned unfolded state. The independent folding pathways explain the comparable quality of models based on stretched exponential and multiexponential fitting of the kinetic traces at low temperature. The rearrangement of bulky side chains, and in particular their reorientation with respect to the cross-linker, makes the EAAAR peptide a slower folder at 281 K than a similar peptide devoid of the three glutamate side chains. On the basis of this simulation result, extracted from a total MD sampling of 1.0 ms, a mutant with additional bulky side chains (three methionines replacing alanines at positions 2, 7, and 12) is suggested to fold slower than the EAAAR peptide. This prediction is confirmed by time-resolved IR spectroscopy.},

Depending on the nature of the anion, these salts react with palladium chloride to form [C(3)CNpy](2)[PdCl(4)] when the anion is Cl(-) and complexes of the formula [PdCl(2)(C(3)CNpy)(2)][anion](2) when the anion is PF(6)(-), BF(4)(-), or N(SO(2)CF(3))(2)(-). The solid-state structures of [C(3)CNpy]Cl and [C(3)CNpy](2)[PdCl(4)] have been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The catalytic activity of these palladium complexes following immobilization in both N-butylpyridinium and nitrile-functionalized ionic liquids has been evaluated in Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions. All of the palladium complexes show good catalytic activity, but recycling and reuse is considerably superior in the nitrile-functionalized ionic liquid. Inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy reveals that the presence of the coordinating nitrile moiety in the ionic liquid leads to a significant decrease in palladium leaching relative to simple N-alkylpyridinium ionic liquids. Palladium nanoparticles have been identified as the active catalyst in the Stille reaction and were characterized using transmission electron microscopy.},

To probe the presence of such inhomogeneities, we apply complex network analysis methods to a molecular dynamics simulation at room temperature. This study provides both a structural and quantitative characterization of kinetically homogeneous substates present in bulk water. We find that the conformation-space network is highly modular, and that structural properties of water molecules are spatially correlated over at least two solvation shells. From a kinetic point of view, the free energy surface is characterized by multiple heterogeneous metastable regions with different populations and marginal barriers separating them. The typical time scale of hopping between them is 200-400 fs. A scanning in temperature reveals that those substates can be stabilized either entropically or enthalpically. The latter resembles an icelike domain that extends for at least two solvation shells.},

abstract = {Fuels and industrial chemicals that are conventionally derived from fossil resources could potentially be produced in a renewable, sustainable manner by an electrochemical process that operates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, using only water, CO2, and electricity as inputs. To enable this technology, improved catalysts must be developed. Herein, we report trends in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 on a broad group of seven transition metal surfaces: Au, Ag, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pt, and Fe. Contrary to conventional knowledge in the field, all metals studied are capable of producing methane or methanol. We quantify reaction rates for these two products and describe catalyst activity and selectivity in the framework of CO binding energies for the different metals. While selectivity toward methane or methanol is low for most of these metals, the fact that they are all capable of producing these products, even at a low rate, is important new knowledge. This study reveals a richer surface chemistry for transition metals than previously known and provides new insights to guide the development of improved CO2 conversion catalysts.},

All of these polymers have similar chemical composition (approximately 82 wt.% ethylene oxide), but the crosslink density and the content and chemistry of chain end groups are different. The effect of chain end groups and crosslink density on mass density, glass transition temperature (Tg), free volume, and H2, N2, CH4and CO2transport properties of the polymers was determined. The effect of temperature on gas permeability and solubility was also investigated. Many of the samples were amorphous. However, samples with high concentrations of PEGMEA could crystallize, and the formation of crystalline regions significantly decreased permeability. A generalized free volume model was used to interpret the effect of crosslink density and chain end groups on gas permeability and diffusivity, where free volume was characterized using two techniques: (1) density and group contribution theory, and (2) positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Finally, the potential application of these materials for CO2/light gas separations was explored. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fluorescein-isothiocyanate adduct of bovine serum albumin was used as a model for studying the kinetics of protonation of a distinguishable site on a protein. Fast perturbation of the bulk pH, by the laser induced proton pulse, led to transient protonation of the dye as monitored at 441 nm. The dynamics were measured over a wide range of prepulse pH values (7-8.5) and analyzed by a numerical solution of four coupled differential equations which define the kinetics of the following reactants: The proton emitter, the covalently bound dye, and the protonatable groups of the protein, carboxyls, and amines. Through successive iteration we derived a single set of rate constants which predict the dynamics of the reaction at any given initial condition (concentration of reactants or pH). Both carboxyls and lysines of the protein are involved in the protonation of the covalently bound dye. The carboxyls act as efficient primary acceptors of the bulk protons, followed by proton transfer to more basic moieties. Within a microsecond bulk and protein are in equilibrium, while proton distribution between surface groups is over in less than 5 $\mu$s. This experimentally tested model quantitatively accounts for the effect of neighboring groups on the protonation dynamics of a site located among them. {\textcopyright} 1988 American Chemical Society.},

In an effort to account for interactions with hydrogen bonding solvents in terms of electrostatics, we study the vibrational dynamics of the amide I coordinate of N-methylacetamide in prototypical polar solvents: D2O, CDCl3, and DMSO-d6. These three solvents have varying hydrogen bonding strengths, and provide three distinct solvent environments for the amide group. The frequency−frequency correlation function, the orientational correlation function, and the vibrational relaxation rate of the amide I vibration in each solvent are retrieved by using three-pulse vibrational photon echoes, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, and pump−probe spectroscopy. Direct comparisons are made to molecular dynamics simulations. We find good quantitative agreement between the experimentally retrieved and simulated correlation functions over all time scales when the solute−solvent interactions are determined from the electrostatic potential between the solvent and the atomic sites of the amide group.},

The ionic liquid may be used as a medium in which polymerizations take place or into which a polymer may be dissolved or dispersed to enable a further chemical transformation or materials processing step to be carried out. Ionic liquid functionality may also be incorporated into the polymer itself, by the use of suitably derivatized monomers, by a post-polymerization reaction or simply by the formation of a composite comprising (at least) a polymer and an ionic liquid. The use of ionic liquids in such chemical and material processing necessitates an appreciation of their effect on reactivity and the forces that govern solubility and solvation. These topics are at an early stage of investigation, none more so than in respect of polymers and polymerization. This review surveys published material up to July 2006 relevant to polymer solubility and solubilization in ionic liquids.},

abstract = {While molar volume-based models for gas solubility in ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed, free volume within the IL can be shown to be the underlying property driving gas solubility and selecitivity. Previously published observations as to the distinct differences in solubility trends for gases such as CH4 and N2 relative to CO2 in systematically varied ILs can be attributed to positive and negative effects arising from increasing free volume with increasing alkyl chain length. Through the use of COSMOtherm as a powerful and rapid tool to calculate free volumes in 165 existing and theoretical 1-n-alkyl-3- methylimidazolium (CnmimX) ILs, a previously unreported, yet speculated, critical underlying relationship between gas solubility in ILs is herein described. These results build upon previous assertions that Regular Solution Theory is applicable to imidazolium-based ILs, which appeared to indicate that a global maximum had already been observed for CO2 solubility in imidazolium-based ILs. However, the findings of this computational study suggest that the perceived maximum in CO2 solubility might be exceeded through rational design of ILs. We observe that although Henrys constants in ILs are dependent on the inverse of molar volume and free volume, the volume-normalized solubility of CH4 and N2 are proportional to free volume, while CO2 is inversely proportional to the square root of free volume. Our free volume model is compared to experimental data for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity, and a nearly identical plot of selectivity relative to IL molar volume can be generated from the computational method alone. The overall implication is that large, highly delocalized anions paired with imidazolium cations that have minimally sized alkyl chains may hold the key to achieving greater CO2 solubility and selectivity in ILs.},

                        1H NMR and kinetic measurements in order to investigate the properties of the ionic liquid within the restricted geometry provided by microemulsions and the interactions of the ionic liquid with the interface. Experimental results show a significant difference between the interfaces of normal water and the new ionic liquid microemulsions. Absorption solvatochromic shift experiments and kinetic studies on the aminolysis of 4-nitrophenyl laurate by n-decylamine show that the polarity at the interface of the ionic liquid in oil microemulsions (IL/O) is higher than at the interface of water in oil microemulsions (W/O) despite the fact that the polarity of [bmim][BF4-] is lower than the polarity of water. 
                        1H NMR experiments showed that an increase in the ionic liquid content of the microemulsion led to an increase in the interaction between [bmim][BF4-] and TX-100. The reason for the higher polarity of the microemulsions with the ionic liquid can be explained in terms of the incorporation of higher levels of the ionic liquid at the interface of the microemulsions, as compared to water in the traditional systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The process by which a protein folds into its native conformation is highly relevant to biology and human health yet still poorly understood. One reason for this is that folding takes place over a wide range of timescales, from nanoseconds to seconds or longer, depending on the protein. Conventional stopped-flow mixers have allowed measurement of folding kinetics starting at about 1 ms. We have recently developed a microfluidic mixer that dilutes denaturant $\sim$100-fold in $\sim$8 $\mu$s. Unlike a stopped-flow mixer, this mixer operates in the laminar flow regime in which turbulence does not occur. The absence of turbulence allows precise numeric simulation of all flows within the mixer with excellent agreement to experiment. Laminar flow is achieved for Reynolds numbers Re ≤100. For aqueous solutions, this requires micron scale geometries. We use a hard substrate, such as silicon or fused silica, to make channels 5-10 $\mu$m wide and 10 $\mu$m deep (See Figure 1). The smallest dimensions, at the entrance to the mixing region, are on the order of 1 $\mu$m in size. The chip is sealed with a thin glass or fused silica coverslip for optical access. Typical total linear flow rates are $\sim$1 m/s, yielding Re$\sim$10, but the protein consumption is only $\sim$0.5 nL/s or 1.8 $\mu$L/hr. Protein concentration depends on the detection method: For tryptophan fluorescence the typical concentration is 100 $\mu$M (for 1 Trp/protein) and for FRET the typical concentration is $\sim$100 nM. The folding process is initiated by rapid dilution of denaturant from 6 M to 0.06 M guanidine hydrochloride. The protein in high denaturant flows down a central channel and is met on either side at the mixing region by buffer without denaturant moving $\sim$100 times faster (see Figure 2). This geometry causes rapid constriction of the protein flow into a narrow jet $\sim$100 nm wide. Diffusion of the light denaturant molecules is very rapid, while diffusion of the heavy protein molecules is much slower, diffusing less than 1 $\mu$m in 1 ms. The difference in diffusion constant of the denaturant and the protein results in rapid dilution of the denaturant from the protein stream, reducing the effective concentration of the denaturant around the protein. The protein jet flows at a constant rate down the observation channel and fluorescence of the protein during folding can be observed using a scanning confocal microscope.},

This suggests that it is not always sufficient to classify individual water molecules when studying some aspects of hydrogen-bond dynamics, rather, one should consider the topology of the local structure around a given water molecule.},

abstract = {This thesis is a summary of five papers with focus on adsorption processes of various monocarboxylates and aminocarboxylates at the water/goethite interface. Interaction of organic acids at the water/mineral interfaces are of importance in biogeochemical processes, since such processes have potential to alter mobility and bioavailability of the acids and metal ions. In order to determine the coordination chemistry of acetate, benzoate, cyclohexanecarboxylate, sarcosine, MIDA (methyliminediacetic acid), EDDA (ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid) and EDTA (ethylenediamine-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) upon adsorption to the goethite ($\alpha$-FeOOH) surface, a combination of quantitative measurements with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was utilized. Over the pH range studied here (pH 3- 9) all ligands, except for sarcosine, have been found to form surface complexes with goethite. In general, these were characterized as outer sphere surface complexes i.e. with no direct interaction with surface Fe(III) metal ions. Furthermore, two types of different outer-sphere complexes were identified, the solvent- surface hydration-separated ion pair, and hydration-shared ion pair. For the monocarboxylate surface complexes distinction between these two could be made. At high pH values the solvent-surface hydration-separated ion pair was the predominating complex, while at low pH the surface complex is stabilized through the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with the goethite surface. However, it was not possible to clearly separate between the two outer-sphere complexes for coordination of aminocarboxylates with the surface of goethite. Additionally, EDDA also formed an inner-sphere surface complex at high pH values. Additionally, EDDA also formed an inner-sphere surface complex at high pH values. The EDDA molecule was suggested to coordinate to the surface by forming a five membered ring with an iron at the goethite surface, through the amine and carboxylate groups. Contrary to the other ligands studied, EDTA significantly induced dissolution of goethite. Some of the dissolved iron, in the form of highly stable FeEDTA- solution complex, was indicated to re-adsorb to the mineral surface as a ternary complex. Similar ternary surface complexes were also found in the Ga(III)EDTA/goethite system, and quantitative and spectroscopic studies on adsorption of Ga(III) in presence and absence of EDTA showed that EDTA considerably effects speciation of gallium at goethite surface. The collective results in this thesis show that the affinity of these ligands for the surface of goethite is primarily governed by their chemical composition and structure, and especially important are the types, numbers and relative position of functional groups within the molecular structure.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are liquids comprised totally of ions. However, not all of the ions present appear to be available to participate in conduction processes, to a degree that is dependent on the nature of the ionic liquid and its structure. There is much interest in quantifying and understanding this 'degree of ionicity' phenomenon. In this paper we present transport data for a range of ionic liquids and evaluate the data firstly in terms of the Walden plot as an approximate and readily accessible approach to estimating ionicity. An adjusted Walden plot that makes explicit allowance for differences in ion sizes is shown to be an improvement to this approach for the series of ionic liquids described. In some cases, where diffusion measurements are possible, it is feasible to directly quantify ionicity via the Nernst-Einstein equation, confirming the validity of the adjusted Walden plot approach. Some of the ionic liquids studied exhibit ionicity values very close to ideal; this is discussed in terms of a model of a highly associated liquid in which the ion correlations have similar impact on both the diffusive and conductive motions. Ionicity, as defined, is thus a useful measure of adherence to the Nernst-Einstein equation, but is not necessarily a measure of ion availability in the chemical sense.},

In order to investigate the possible utility of such data, the infrared spectra of 159 pure inorganic compounds (principally salts of polyatomic ions) have been obtained and are presented here in both graphical and tabular form. A table of character- istic frequencies for 33 polyatomic ions is given. These characteristic frequencies are shown to be useful in the qualitative analysis of inorganic un- knowns. Still more fruitful is a combination of emission analysis, infrared examination, and x-ray diffraction, in that order. Several actual examples are given. It is evident that a number of problems involving inorganic salts containing polyatomic ions will benefit by infrared study. The chief limitation at present is the practical necessity of working with powders, which makes it difficult to put the spectra on a quantitative basis.},

New questions are posed, and an active debate is ongoing regarding the nature of nanoscale ordering in ionic liquids.

abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool to study the mechanisms that dominate the properties of ionic liquids (ILs) on the atomistic and molecular level. However, the basis for any molecular dynamics simulation is an accurate force field describing the effective interactions between all atoms in the IL. Normally this is done by empirical potentials which can be partially derived from quantum mechanical calculations on simple subunits or have been fitted to experimental data. Unfortunately, the number of accurate classical non-polarizable models for ILs that allow a reasonable description of both dynamical and statical properties is still low. However, the strongly increasing computational power allows one to apply computationally more expensive methods, and even polarizable-force-field-based models on time and length scales long enough to ensure a proper sampling of the phase space. This review attempts to summarize recent achievements and methods in the development of classical force fields for ionic liquids. As this class of salts covers a large number of compounds, we focus our review on imidazolium-based ionic liquids, but show that the main conclusions are valid for non-imidazolium salts, too. Insight obtained from recent electronic density functional results into the parametrization of partial charges and on the influence of polarization effects in bulk ILs is highlighted. An overview is given of different available force fields, ranging from the atomistic to the coarse-grained level, covering implicit as well as explicit modeling of polarization. We show that the recently popular usage of the ion charge as fit parameter can looked upon as treating polarization effects in a mean-field matter.},

abstract = {A knowledge of various thermophys. (in particular transport) properties of ionic liqs. (ILs) is crucial from the point of view of potential applications of these fluids in chem. and related industries. In this work, over 13 000 data points of temp.- and pressure-dependent viscosity of 1484 ILs were retrieved from more than 450 research papers published in the open literature in the last three decades. The data were critically revised and then used to develop and test a new model allowing in silico predictions of the viscosities of ILs on the basis of the chem. structures of their cations and anions. The model employs a two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (FFANN) strategy to represent the relationship between the viscosity and the input variables: temp., pressure, and group contributions (GCs). In total, the resulting GC-FFANN model employs 242 GC-type mol. descriptors that are capable of accurately representing the viscosity behavior of ILs composed of 901 distinct ions. The neural network training, validation, and testing processes, involving 90, 5, and 5% of the whole data pool, resp., gave mean square errors of 0.0334, 0.0595, and 0.0603 log units, corresponding to squared correlation coeffs. of 0.986, 0.973, and 0.972 and overall relative deviations at the level of 11.1, 13.8, and 14.7%, resp.

abstract = {To fully leverage the advantages of ionic liquids for many applications, it is necessary to immobilize or encapsulate the fluids within an inert, robust, quasi-solid-state format that does not disrupt their many desirable, inherent features. The formation of ionogels represents a promising approach; however, many earlier approaches suffer from solvent/ matrix incompatibility, optical opacity, embrittlement, matrix- limited thermal stability, and/or inadequate ionic liquid loading. We offer a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a straightforward and effective strategy toward flexible and durable ionogels comprising bacterial cellulose supports hosting in excess of 99% ionic liquid by total weight. Termed bacterial cellulose ionogels (BCIGs), these gels are prepared using a facile solvent-exchange process equally amenable to water-miscible and water- immiscible ionic liquids. A suite of characterization tools were used to study the preliminary (thermo)physical and structural properties of BCIGs, including no-deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Our analyses reveal that the weblike structure and high crystallinity of the host bacterial cellulose microfibrils are retained within the BCIG. Notably, not only can BCIGs be tailored in terms of shape, thickness, and choice of ionic liquid, they can also be designed to host virtually any desired active, functional species, including fluorescent probes, nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots, carbon nanotubes), and gas-capture reagents. In this paper, we also present results for fluorescent designer BCIG chemosensor films responsive to ammonia or hydrogen sulfide vapors on the basis of incorporating selective fluorogenic probes within the ionogels. Additionally, a thermometric BCIG hosting the excimer- forming fluorophore 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane was devised which exhibited a ratiometric (two-color) fluorescence output that responded precisely to changes in local temperature. The ionogel approach introduced here is simple and has broad generality, offering intriguing potential in (bio)analytical sensing, catalysis, membrane separations, electrochemistry, energy storage devices, and flexible electronics and displays},

abstract = {We developed a strategy for identifying positions in G protein-coupled receptors that are amenable to bioorthogonal modification with a peptide epitope tag under cell culturing conditions. We introduced the unnatural amino acid p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) into human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) at site-specific amber codon mutations. We then used strain-promoted azide-alkyne [3+2] cycloaddition to label the azF-CCR5 variants with a FLAG peptide epitope-conjugated aza-dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) reagent. A microtiter plate-based sandwich fluorophore-linked immunosorbent assay was used to probe simultaneously the FLAG epitope and the receptor using infrared dye-conjugated antibodies so that the extent of DBCO incorporation, corresponding nominally to labeling efficiency, could be quantified ratiometrically. The extent of incorporation of DBCO at the various sites was evaluated in the context of a recent crystal structure of maraviroc-bound CCR5. We observed that labeling efficiency varied dramatically depending on the topological location of the azF in CCR5. Interestingly, position 109 in transmembrane helix 3, located in a hydrophobic cavity on the extracellular side of the receptor, was labeled most efficiently. Because the bioorthogonal labeling and detection strategy described might be used to introduce a variety of different peptide epitopes or fluorophores into engineered expressed receptors, it might prove to be useful for a wide range of applications, including single-molecule detection studies of receptor trafficking and signaling mechanism.},

abstract = {A vibrational transition frequency can couple to its environment through a directional vector interaction. In such cases, reorientation of the vibrational transition dipole (molecular orientational relaxation) and its frequency fluctuations can be strongly coupled. It was recently shown [Kramer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 184505 (2015)] that differing frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF) decays, due to reorientation-induced spectral diffusion (RISD), are observed with different two-dimensional infrared polarization configurations when such strong coupling is present. The FFC functional forms were derived for the situation in which all spectral diffusion is due to reorientational motion. We extend the previous theory to include vibrational frequency evolution (spectral diffusion) caused by structural fluctuations of the medium. Model systems with diffusive reorientation and several regimes of structural spectral diffusion rates are analyzed for first order Stark effect interactions. Additionally, the transition dipole reorientational motion in complex environments is frequently not completely diffusive. Several periods of restricted angular motion (wobbling-in-a-cone) may precede the final diffusive orientational randomization. The polarization-weighted FFCF decays are presented in this case of restricted transition dipole wobbling. With these extensions to the polarization-dependent FFCF expressions, the structural spectral diffusion dynamics of methanol in the room temperature ionic liquid 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate can be separated quantitatively from RISD using the experimental center line slope data. In addition, prior results on the spectral diffusion of water, methanol, and ethanol in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide are re-examined to elucidate the influence of reorientation on the data, which were interpreted in terms of structural fluctuations.},

abstract = {Cancer nanotherapeutics are progressing at a steady rate; research and development in the field has experienced an exponential growth since early 2000's. The path to the commercialization of oncology drugs is long and carries significant risk; however, there is considerable excitement that nanoparticle technologies may contribute to the success of cancer drug development. The pace at which pharmaceutical companies have formed partnerships to use proprietary nanoparticle technologies has considerably accelerated. It is now recognized that by enhancing the efficacy and/or tolerability of new drug candidates, nanotechnology can meaningfully contribute to create differentiated products and improve clinical outcome. This review describes the lessons learned since the commercialization of the first-generation nanomedicines including DOXIL{\textregistered} and Abraxane{\textregistered}. It explores our current understanding of targeted and non-targeted nanoparticles that are under various stages of development, including BIND-014 and MM-398. It highlights the opportunities and challenges faced by nanomedicines in contemporary oncology, where personalized medicine is increasingly the mainstay of cancer therapy. We revisit the fundamental concepts of enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and explore the mechanisms proposed to enhance preferential “retention” in the tumor, whether using active targeting of nanoparticles, binding of drugs to their tumoral targets or the presence of tumor associated macrophages. The overall objective of this review is to enhance our understanding in the design and development of therapeutic nanoparticles for treatment of cancers. },

abstract = {Water has many kinetic and thermodynamic properties that exhibit an anomalous dependence on temperature, in particular in the supercooled phase. These anomalies have long been interpreted in terms of underlying structural causes, and their experimental characterization points to the existence of a singularity at a temperature of about 225 K. Further insights into the nature and origin of this singularity might be gained by completely characterizing the structural relaxation in supercooled water. But until now, such a characterization has only been realized in simulations that agree with the predictions of simple mode-coupling theory; unambiguous experimental support for this surprising conclusion is, however, not yet available. Here we report time-resolved optical Kerr effect measurements that unambiguously demonstrate that the structural relaxation of liquid and weakly supercooled water follows the behaviour predicted by simple mode-coupling theory. Our findings thus support the interpretation of the singularity as a purely dynamical transition. That is, the anomalous behaviour of weakly supercooled water can be explained using a fully dynamic model and without needing to invoke a thermodynamic origin. In this regard, water behaves like many other, normal molecular liquids that are fragile glass-formers.},

abstract = {The authors have studied the multielectron dissociative ionization of CO using a linearly polarized YAG laser delivering 1015 W cm-2 at 1064 nm, with a pulse duration of 30 ps. By firing two identical laser pulses, with crossed polarizations and a time delay of 800 ps, they show that an intense laser field forces all the molecules to align along its polarization vector. The molecular confinement increases with the dissociation threshold energies of the decay paths involved. Surprisingly enough, the different molecular decay paths observed with a 30 ps pulse release the same 'magic' kinetic energies as already observed with 100 fs, 600 fs and 2 ps pulse durations.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as possible carbon dioxide (CO2) capture media; thus, it is useful to understand the dynamics of both the dissolved gas and its IL environment as well as how altering an IL affects these dynamics. With increasing alkyl chain length, it is well-established that ILs obtain a mesoscopic structural feature assigned to polar–apolar segregation, and the change in structure with chain length affects the dynamics. Here, the dynamics of CO2 in a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ILs, in which the alkyl group is ethyl, butyl, hexyl, or decyl, were investigated using ultrafast infrared spectroscopy by measuring the reorientation and spectral diffusion of carbon dioxide in the ILs. It was found that reorientation of the carbon dioxide occurs on three time scales, which correspond to two different time scales of restricted wobbling-in-a-cone motions and a long-time complete diffusive reorientation. Complete reorientation slows with increasing...},

abstract = {The sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum from the water/[1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine] (DMPC) interface in the OH stretching mode region of water is simulated and shows three spectral peaks which are assigned to different environments. The weak 3590 cm−1 peak is attributed to a few water molecules coupled to the glycerol backbone of DMCP. The 3470 cm−1 feature comes from the top water layer adjacent to the hydrophilic headgroup of DMPC. The 3290 cm−1 peak arises from the near-bulk water nonadjacent to DMPC. The stretching mode corresponding to the 3290 cm−1 peak is strongly coupled to the neighboring water molecules. In contrast, the 3470 cm−1 mode is decoupled from the surrounding water molecules, and the orientation of water is governed by DMPC. This decoupling explains the slow relaxation dynamics of water measured in the time-resolved SFG experiment. Despite the similarity of the SFG spectra, the peak origins of water/lipid and water/vapor interfaces are different.},

It establishes a relationship between the linear response of a system under a time-dependent perturbation and time correlations of certain observables in equilibrium. Here we derive a generalization of the theorem which can be applied to any Markov quantum system and makes use of the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD). There are several important benefits from our approach. First, such a formulation clarifies the relation between classical and quantum versions of the equilibrium FDT. Second, and more important, it facilitates the extension of the FDT to arbitrary quantum Markovian evolution, as given by quantum maps. Third, it clarifies the connection between the FDT and quantum metrology in systems with a non-equilibrium steady state.},

abstract = {To characterize the dynamic behavior of calmodulin in solution, we have carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Ca2+-loaded structure. The crystal structure of calmodulin was placed in a solvent sphere of radius 44 A, and 6 Cl- and 22 Na+ ions were included to neutralize the system and to model a 150 mM salt concentration. The total number of atoms was 32,867. During the 3-ns simulation, the structure exhibits large conformational changes on the nanosecond time scale. The central alpha-helix, which has been shown to unwind locally upon binding of calmodulin to target proteins, bends and unwinds near residue Arg74. We interpret this result as a preparative step in the more extensive structural transition observed in the "flexible linker" region 74-82 of the central helix upon complex formation. The major structural change is a reorientation of the two Ca2+-binding domains with respect to each other and a rearrangement of alpha-helices in the N-terminus domain that makes the hydrophobic target peptide binding site more accessible. This structural rearrangement brings the domains to a more favorable position for target binding, poised to achieve the orientation observed in the complex of calmodulin with myosin light-chain kinase. Analysis of solvent structure reveals an inhomogeneity in the mobility of water in the vicinity of the protein, which is attributable to the hydrophobic effect exerted by calmodulin's binding sites for target peptides.},

abstract = {Small IR probe molecules have been found to be useful to measure local electric fields in condensed phases and proteins and also to study nucleic acid and protein structure and dynamics by monitoring their vibrational couplings and frequency shifts. However, it is still difficult to accurately describe the vibrational solvatochromic frequency shifts of such IR probes, because the local electric fields produced by surrounding solvent molecules or by protein peptide and side groups are spatially non-uniform and highly inhomogeneous around a probe. We recently developed a distributed interaction site model to describe the vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of nitrile-, thiocyanato-, and azido-derivatized compounds and amino acids in solutions. Here, the nitrile or azido stretch is the maker mode. It was found that those interaction sites distributed over the IR probe molecule collectively act as an antenna sensing local electric field distributions around the IR probes. Once the vibrational solvatochromism of a given IR probe is understood, it becomes possible to quantitatively describe their vibrational Stark effects. Carrying out quantum chemistry calculations of cyanide, thiocyanate, and azide anions in water clusters, we extended the distributed site model for ionic IR probes and calculated the vibrational Stark tuning rates for direct comparisons with experimental results. It turns out that the charge transfers from an anionic solute to surrounding water molecules are significant, but their effects on vibrational solvatochromism and electrochromism of pseudohalide ionic IR probes are not. We anticipate that the present computational results will be of use to establish the relationship between vibrational frequency of an ionic IR probe and local electric field in condensed phases and protein matrices.},

The large system displays several changes upon neglect of dispersion correction, the most striking one is the surprising decrease of the well-known microhetero- geneity which is accompanied by an increase of side chain hydrogen atom-anion interplay. For the diffusion coefficient, we observe a correction towards experimental behavior in terms of the cation becoming faster than the anion with dispersion correction. Changes in the electronic structure upon dispersion correction are reflected in larger/smaller dipole moments for anions/cations also seen in the calculated IR spectrum. The energetics of different ion pair dimer subsystems (polar and non-polar) are in accordance with the analysis of the trajectories: A detailed balance in the ionic liquid system determines its particular behavior. While the overall interaction terms for dispersion-corrected calculations are higher, the decrease in microheterogeneity upon inclusion of dispersion interaction becomes obvious due to the relation between all contributions to polar-polar terms. For the small system, we clearly observe the well known behavior that the hybrid functionals show higher reaction barriers than the pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals.

abstract = {A core/shell model has often been used to describe water confined to the interior of reverse micelles. The validity of this model for water encapsulated in AOT/isooctane reverse micelles ranging in diameter from 1.7 to 28 nm (w0 = 2−60) and bulk water is investigated using four experimental observables: the hydroxyl stretch absorption spectra, vibrational population relaxation times, orientational relaxation rates, and spectral diffusion dynamics. The time dependent observables are measured with ultrafast infrared spectrally resolved pump−probe and vibrational echo spectroscopies. Major progressive changes appear in all observables as the system moves from bulk water to the smallest water nanopool, w0 = 2. The dynamics are readily distinguishable for reverse micelle sizes smaller than 7 nm in diameter (w0 = 20) compared to the response of bulk water. The results also demonstrate that the size dependent absorption spectra and population relaxation times can be quantitatively predicted using a core−shell model in which the properties of the core (interior of the nanopool) are taken to be those of bulk water and the properties of the shell (water associated with the headgroups) are taken to be those of w0 = 2. A weighted sum of the core and shell components reproduces the size dependent spectra and the nonexponential population relaxation dynamics. However, the same model does not reproduce the spectral diffusion and the orientational relaxation experiments. It is proposed that, when hydrogen bond structural rearrangement is involved (orientational relaxation and spectral diffusion), dynamical coupling between the shell and the core cause the water nanopool to display more homogeneous dynamics. Therefore, the absorption spectra and vibrational lifetime decays can discern different hydrogen bonding environments whereas orientational and spectral diffusion correlation functions predict that the dynamics are size dependent but not as strongly spatially dependent within a reverse micelle.},

Different conformers of a cation-anion pair based on their molecular interactions are simulated in the gas phase and in a dielectric continuum solvent environment. Although the ordering of conformers in energy varies with theoretical methods, their predictions for three lowest energy conformers in the gas phase are similar. Strong C-H---N interactions between the acidic hydrogen atom of the cation imidazole ring and the nitrogen atom of the anion are predicted for either the lowest or second lowest energy conformer. In a continuum solvent, different theoretical methods yield the same ion-pair conformation for the lowest energy state. In both phases, the density functional method predicts that the anion is in a trans conformation in the lowest energy ion pair state. The theoretical results are compared with experimental observations from Raman scattering and IR absorption spectroscopies and manifestations of the molecular interactions in the vibrational spectra are discussed. The directions of the frequency shifts of the characteristic vibrations relative to the free anion and cation are explained by calculating the difference electron density coupled with electron density topography.},

Spatial correlation functions in the amplitude and phase of amide I oscillators quantitatively address the extent of delocalization and the $\alpha$ helical and $\beta$ sheet character of these modes.

This is important in light of the charge and polarity type alternations that have recently been shown to be present in the case of liquids with cations of moderately long linear tails. For this study, we have chosen to use the 1-alkyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium, Pyrr(1,n(+)) with n = 5 or 7, as systems with linear tails, 1-(2-ethylhexyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium, Pyrr(1,EtHx(+)), as a system with a branched tail, and 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium, Pyrr(1,ChxMe(+)), as a system with a cyclic tail. We put these results into context by comparing these data with recently published results for the Pyrr(1,n(+))/NTf2(-) ionic liquids with n = 4, 6, 8, and 10.1,2 General methods for interpreting the structure function S(q) in terms of q-dependent natural partitionings are described. This allows for an in-depth analysis of the scattering data based on molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories that highlight the effect of modifying the cationic tail.},

abstract = {A series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) based on 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([emim](+)) with different aprotic heterocyclic anions (AHAs) were synthesized and characterized as potential electrolyte candidates for lithium ion batteries. The density and transport properties of these ILs were measured over the temperature range between 283.15 and 343.15 K at ambient pressure. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self-diffusion coefficient, and molar conductivity) is fit well by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation. The best-fit VFT parameters, as well as linear fits to the density, are reported. The ionicity of these ILs was quantified by the ratio of the molar conductivity obtained from the ionic conductivity and molar concentration to that calculated from the self-diffusion coefficients using the Nernst-Einstein equation. The results of this study, which is based on ILs composed of both a planar cation and planar anions, show that many of the [emim][AHA] ILs exhibit very good conductivity for their viscosities and provide insight into the design of ILs with enhanced dynamics that may be suitable for electrolyte applications.},

abstract = {Molecular monolayers exhibit structural and dynamical properties that are different from their bulk counterparts due to their interaction with the substrate. Extracting these distinct properties is crucial for a better understanding of processes such as heterogeneous catalysis and interfacial charge transfer. Ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopic techniques such as 2D infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy are powerful tools for understanding molecular dynamics in complex bulk systems. Here, we build on technical advancements in 2D IR and heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to study a CO 2 reduction catalyst on nanostructured TiO 2 with interferometric 2D SFG spectroscopy. Our method combines phase-stable heterodyne detection employing an external local oscillator with a broad-band pump pulse pair to provide the first high spectral and temporal resolution 2D SFG spectra of a transparent material. We determine the overall molecular orientation of the catalyst and find that there is a static structural heterogeneity reflective of different local environments at the surface. H eterogeneous chemistry drives numerous biological, chemical, and physical processes. Here, overall properties are directly linked to molecular characteristics, including structure, dynamics, and energy transfer capabilities at the interface. However, characterizing interfacial properties of complex heterogeneous systems is technically challenging. As an important model system, we focus on a molecular CO 2 reduction catalyst covalently bound to nanostructured TiO 2 . Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to liquid fuels has been a high-priority goal in response to the rise in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the need for environmentally friendly alternative energy sources. 1−3},

The density, viscosity, and conductivity of the three neat ILs were also determined at various temperatures. Upon the basis of the molar conductivity of the mixtures and that of the neat ILs of the same viscosity, the degree of dissociation of ILs in the solutions was investigated. It can be deduced that the organic solvents enhance the ionic association of the ILs, the effect depending on the solvent dielectric constant, while water promotes dissociation significantly due to its high dielectric constant and its ability to form strong hydrogen bonds with the anions of the ILs.},

abstract = {Ion selectivity is one of the basic properties that define an ion channel. Most tetrameric cation channels, which include the K+, Ca2+, Na+ and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, probably share a similar overall architecture in their ion-conduction pore, but the structural details that determine ion selection are different. Although K+ channel selectivity has been well studied from a structural perspective, little is known about the structure of other cation channels. Here we present crystal structures of the NaK channel from Bacillus cereus, a non-selective tetrameric cation channel, in its Na+- and K+-bound states at 2.4 A and 2.8 A resolution, respectively. The NaK channel shares high sequence homology and a similar overall structure with the bacterial KcsA K+ channel, but its selectivity filter adopts a different architecture. Unlike a K+ channel selectivity filter, which contains four equivalent K+-binding sites, the selectivity filter of the NaK channel preserves the two cation-binding sites equivalent to sites 3 and 4 of a K+ channel, whereas the region corresponding to sites 1 and 2 of a K+ channel becomes a vestibule in which ions can diffuse but not bind specifically. Functional analysis using an 86Rb flux assay shows that the NaK channel can conduct both Na+ and K+ ions. We conclude that the sequence of the NaK selectivity filter resembles that of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and its structure may represent that of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel pore.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are being investigated as potential solvents for pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture. In pre-combustion applications, knowledge of the selectivity of CO2 over H2 in high-pressure and high-temperature gas mixtures is crucial. In the present work, the solubility of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and their mixture in the ionic liquids 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([Cnmim+][Tf2N?], n = 4, 6) is computed using the isothermal?isobaric Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (NPT-GEMC) method. The predicted solubility for CO2 and H2 in 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([C4mim+][Tf2N?]) and 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([C6mim+][Tf2N?]) are compared with experimental results. It is found that the predicted absorption isotherms for pure gases in the studied ionic liquids (ILs) agree reasonably well with the available experimental results. The Henry?s Law constants, partial molar enthalpies of absorption, partial molar volumes, and the percentage change in the volumes of the IL phase upon absorption of CO2 and H2 in [C4mim+][Tf2N?] and [C6mim+][Tf2N?] are estimated at different temperatures and are compared with the experimental data. The results indicate that the solubility of CO2 decreases with increasing temperature, whereas, for H2, it slightly increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with most previous experimental data. Mixed-gas (CO2/H2) experiments are much harder to conduct than pure gas experiments, so it is usually assumed that absorption selectivity is ideal. To test this, mixed gas simulations were also carried out using the NPT-GEMC method. The simulations indicate that the solubility selectivity of CO2 over H2 in [C4mim+][Tf2N?] and [C6mim+][Tf2N?] varies, depending on the vapor phase composition. The selectivities are compared with the Henry?s Law constant ratios and ideal selectivities that are obtained from pure gas isotherms for CO2 and H2 in both ionic liquids. Both computed selectivities and ideal selectivities are close and are different from Henry?s Law constant ratios at 333 K. The results indicate no enhancement in the solubility of H2, because of the presence of CO2 in the IL phase. The selectivity decreases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the simulation study of Shi et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 6531]. This is due to the fact that CO2 solubility decreases with increasing temperature, whereas H2 solubility increases.},

Here, a microscopic description of water structure and dynamics based on configuration-space-networks and molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model is applied to investigate the free-energy landscape of water. The latter is built on top of a large set of water microstates describing the kinetic stability of local hydrogen-bond arrangements up to the second solvation shell. In temperature space, the landscape displays three different regimes. At around ambient conditions, the free-energy surface is characterized by many short-lived basins of attraction which are structurally well-defined (inhomogeneous regime). At lower temperatures instead, the liquid rapidly becomes homogeneous. In this regime, the free energy is funneled-like, with fully coordinated water arrangements at the bottom of the funnel. Finally, a third regime develops below the temperature of maximal compressibility (Widom line) where the funnel becomes steeper with few interconversions between microstates other than the fully coordinated ones. Our results present a way to manage the complexity of water structure and dynamics, connecting microscopic properties to its ensemble behavior.},

Moreover it is demonstrated that the structure of the sequestrated ILs depends strongly on the type of surfactant use to create the RMs.},

The method is used to identify groups of strongly coupled oscillators to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonians, considerably reducing the expense associated with computing infrared spectra of large proteins. The quality of linear and nonlinear spectra generated from block-diagonal Hamiltonians is demonstrated by comparison with spectra generated from full Hamiltonian trajectories. A library of six proteins reveals that vibrational couplings within hydrogen-bonded residues in specific secondary structures give rise to the characteristic amide I line shapes whereas other couplings play a minor role. Exciton delocalization analyses indicate that amide I vibrations in proteins remain largely localized to groups of less than ten residues.},

abstract = {Ionic liquids are liquids comprised totally of ions. However, not all of the ions present appear to be available to participate in conduction processes, to a degree that is dependent on the nature of the ionic liquid and its structure. There is much interest in quantifying and understanding this 'degree of ionicity' phenomenon. In this paper we present transport data for a range of ionic liquids and evaluate the data firstly in terms of the Walden plot as an approximate and readily accessible approach to estimating ionicity. An adjusted Walden plot that makes explicit allowance for differences in ion sizes is shown to be an improvement to this approach for the series of ionic liquids described. In some cases, where diffusion measurements are possible, it is feasible to directly quantify ionicity via the Nernst-Einstein equation, confirming the validity of the adjusted Walden plot approach. Some of the ionic liquids studied exhibit ionicity values very close to ideal; this is discussed in terms of a model of a highly associated liquid in which the ion correlations have similar impact on both the diffusive and conductive motions. Ionicity, as defined, is thus a useful measure of adherence to the Nernst-Einstein equation, but is not necessarily a measure of ion availability in the chemical sense.},

abstract = {We describe the characterization of a new optical CO(2) sensor based on the change in the fluorescence signal intensity of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) in green chemistry reagents--room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). As far as we are aware, this is the first time RTILs, 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (RTIL-I) and 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium bromide (RTIL-II), have been used as matrix materials with HPTS in an optical CO(2) sensor. It should be noted that the solubility of CO(2) in water-miscible ionic liquids is approximately 10 to 20 times that in conventional solvents, polymer matrices, or water. The response of the sensor to gaseous and dissolved CO(2) has been evaluated. The luminescence intensity of HPTS at 519 and 521 nm decreased with the increasing concentrations of CO(2) by 90 and 75% in RTIL-I and RTIL-II, respectively. The response times of the sensing reagents were in the range 1-2 min for switching from nitrogen to CO(2), and 7-10 min for switching from CO(2) to nitrogen. The signal changes were fully reversible and no significant hysteresis was observed during the measurements. The stability of HPTS in RTILs was excellent and when stored in the ambient air of the laboratory there was no significant drift in signal intensity after 7 months. Our stability tests are still in progress.},

@article{Zhang2015a,
abstract = {Self-diffusivities as a function of temperature were computed for 29 different ionic liquids (ILs) covering a wide variety of cation and anion classes. Ideal ionic conductivities ($\sigma$NE) were estimated from the self-diffusivities via the Nernst-Einstein relation. The ion pair (IP) lifetimes ($\tau$IP) and ion cage (IC) lifetimes ($\tau$IC) of each IL were also computed. A linear relationship between the calculated self-diffusivities and the inverse of IP or IC lifetimes was observed. A similar inverse linear relationship was also observed for ideal ionic conductivity. These relationships were found to be independent of temperature and the nature of the IL. These observations connect macroscopic dynamic properties with local atomic-level motions and strongly suggest that the dynamics of ILs are governed by a universal IP or IC forming and breaking mechanism. Thus, in order to design an ionic liquid with enhanced dynamics, one should consider how to minimize IP or IC lifetimes.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from coumarin 480 (C480) to rhodamine 6G (R6G) is studied in a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) microemulsion by picosecond and femtosecond emission spectroscopy. The microemulsion is comprised of the RTIL 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium tetraflouroborate, [pmim][BF4], in TX-100/ benzene. We have studied the microemulsion with and without water. The time constants of FRET were obtained from the risetime of the acceptor (R6G) emission. In the RTIL microemulsion, FRET occurs on multiple time scales: 1, 250, and 3900 ps. In water containing RTIL microemulsion, the rise components are 1.5, 250, and 3900 ps. The 1 and 1.5 ps components are assigned to FRET at a close contact of donor and acceptor (RDA approximately 12 A). This occurs within the highly polar (RTIL/water) pool of the microemulsion. With increase in the excitation wavelength (lambdaex) from 375 to 435 nm, the relative contribution of the ultrafast component of FRET (1 ps) increases from 4% to 100% in the RTIL microemulsion and 12% to 100% in the water containing RTIL microemulsion. It is suggested that at lambdaex = 435 nm, mainly the highly polar RTIL pool is probed where FRET is very fast due to the close proximity of the donor and the acceptor. The very long 3900 ps (RDA approximately 45 A) component may arise from FRET from a donor in the outer periphery of the microemulsion to an acceptor in the polar RTIL pool. The 250 ps component (RDA approximately 29 A) is assigned to FRET from a donor inside the surfactant chains.},

abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy has played an instrumental role in the study of a wide variety of biological questions. However, in many cases, it is impossible or difficult to rely on the intrinsic vibrational modes of biological molecules of interest, such as proteins, to reveal structural and environmental information in a site-specific manner. To overcome this limitation, investigators have dedicated many recent efforts to the development and application of various extrinsic vibrational probes that can be incorporated into biological molecules and used to site-specifically interrogate their structural or environmental properties. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in this rapidly growing research area. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry Volume 66 is March 31, 2015.

abstract = {We detail and considerably extend the analysis recently presented in Science 2006, 311, 832-835 of the molecular mechanism of water reorientation based on molecular dynamics simulations and the analytic framework of the extended jump model (EJM). The water reorientation is shown to occur through large- amplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches.},
